  <summary>Chapter 4: Lists

Next chapter after Datatypes, in this chapter it‚Äôs more focused on how to comprehend how‚Äôs the lists work in Python, how to use them, and how to process it. Without further ado, here‚Äôs the stuff that I learned throughout this chapter:

Chapter 4: Lists

In this chapter, there‚Äôs only one basic exercise but with a multiple task that follows it, so I‚Äôll go ...</summary>

  <summary>Appreciation Words

This learning was possible because I got informed by this GitHub repo and in it there‚Äôs so many learning resources about cyber security, ethical hacking, network, programming and many more. And I stumbled upon e-book titled ‚ÄúFull Speed Python‚Äù by Jo√£o Ventura, where his book teaches python but with such a simple way and hands-on practice too. What I also like about his book ...</summary>

  <summary>Before We Start

Welcome to another post of me yapping about cyber security. This time, I want to yap about how to build your own dashboard in Elastic. This post is done with objective of allowing us to understand how to build dashboard that suit your need or my need while also learning the progress of making it along the way.

  <summary>About This Post

This post made because I thought ‚ÄúOkay, I got my tasked by my workplace to learn how to make Detection Rules and Active Directory. Maybe I could search something on the internet that connect these two?‚Äù And to my surprise there‚Äôs already someone that did what exactly I thought. Shout out to MyDFIR for the video that I used as my main basis and reference throughout this post.

  <summary>A Little Reminder

This is part two, continuation from my previous post(part one) where we walk through installing ELK stack SIEM. On this part two, we will take a look at how to integrating our ELK stack with endpoint, in this case is a Windows VM.

We will learn also what is Filebeat, Fleet Server, Elastic Agent, Elastic Integration, and many more tools for getting our lab work as a complete ...</summary>
