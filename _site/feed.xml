  <summary>Chapter 5: Modules and Functions

This chapter of my Python learning journey is really interesting for me, because I always fascinated as to how computers being able to process complex mathematic problem and with Python it is possible when we import math modules that containing mathematical function, that way we could perform something like this:

import math
print(math.cos(0.0)) 
print(math.ra...</summary>

  <summary>Chapter 4: Lists

Next chapter after Datatypes, in this chapter it’s more focused on how to comprehend how’s the lists work in Python, how to use them, and how to process it. Without further ado, here’s the stuff that I learned throughout this chapter:

First List Exercises


Chapter 4: Lists

In this chapter, there’s only one basic exercise but with a multiple task that follows it, so I’ll go ...</summary>

  <summary>Appreciation Words

This learning was possible because I got informed by this GitHub repo and in it there’s so many learning resources about cyber security, ethical hacking, network, programming and many more. And I stumbled upon e-book titled “Full Speed Python” by João Ventura, where his book teaches python but with such a simple way and hands-on practice too. What I also like about his book ...</summary>

  <summary>Before We Start

Welcome to another post of me yapping about cyber security. This time, I want to yap about how to build your own dashboard in Elastic. This post is done with objective of allowing us to understand how to build dashboard that suit your need or my need while also learning the progress of making it along the way. 

Bild 👍

With that being said, the type of dashboard that we will b...</summary>

  <summary>About This Post

This post made because I thought “Okay, I got my tasked by my workplace to learn how to make Detection Rules and Active Directory. Maybe I could search something on the internet that connect these two?” And to my surprise there’s already someone that did what exactly I thought. Shout out to MyDFIR for the video that I used as my main basis and reference throughout this post.
