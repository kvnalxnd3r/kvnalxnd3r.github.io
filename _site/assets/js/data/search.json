    "content": "Level 7 → Level 8Today we have level 7 and here we gonna learn something new again from this task below.Level 7 TaskNow, we being tasked for finding password stored in txt file and that it located near the word millionth. Well, this is interesting, because for me, I have some cases IRL that when I needed to search some words but I just know the words surrounding it. So, let’s begin how I being able to locate the password by first checking if the data.txt really is in our current directory by using ls command.First, enter the ls command.ls -aWe use -a flag to told linux that we want all of the things in the directory, and we have it. Now that we confirmed the location, I remembered that in the task it hinted that I should look up grep, and I remember also that one of the most used command to search for words, strings, etc. But, I still don’t know how to use grep, so based on a lot of peoples suggestion to always look up man page if in-doubt of linux commands.And here it is, the information contained in the man page.And to my surprise, the answer already contained on the SYNOPSIS part in the man page, and for linux man page consist of several sections like, NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, etc. And for the SYNOPSIS section, it explain how the command is used, and when I sees this, it already answered it. And now, I could just use the command like this below.From the SYNOPSIS section in man page I understand that grep command consist of grep [OPTION ... ] PATTERNS [FILE ... ] that the command first being told, second the option or the flag, third is the pattern in this case “millionth” and finally the file on where to look the patterns. And just like that, I have the password for the next level.Level 8 → Level 9After entering next level, level 8. I presented with this task below.So, on the task we have new hint being Pipeline and Redirection, I know it refers to this | thing but I just couldn’t wrapped my mind at this point of it’s concept. So, let’s see what this is all about by clicking the link attached on the link.Okay…. from that I understand that pipe kinda like combining command like???? Oh gotta tried it to confirm my understanding, but first, let’s check the data.txt existence in our current directory by ls command again.Good, the file exist now all is left to do is to combine the command that I remember will help me search the answer, the sort and uniq command. I remembered that sort from it’s name sorting the output and uniq is that only searching for a uniq occurrence of a string and given the task said that it only occurred once, it’s matched with the condition of the command. So here’s what the man page says about those command.Oh, from the looks of it they’re similar and doesn’t have that much differences. So in my understanding at this point was that, I could just use the pipeline, no matter how the positioning of the command. So here below, me testing my understanding.Hhhhmmmmm…. The output was sorted but the uniq command seems not working. I feels like I’m still poorly understand the pipeline and the commands itself. So, next thing I do was to asked ChatGPT and verified my understanding. Here’s what ChatGPT gives.Ahhhh from that explanation I could conclude that I indeed have misunderstanding of how pipeline and uniq works. So, pipeline function as a way to sent first command output acting as an input for the second command. And because the nature of uniq command that need an input first before being able to executed, it needed to be placed on the second command. And because sort command output’s could work as an input, this made the pipeline comes in handy when conjugating these two commands.And this is what I learn from this, the behavior of the command and the positioning of command in pipeline is important. So, with that in mind, here’s how I finally able to find the pass.And I’ve done it, you noticed that I put -u flag on the uniq command, that is because to help the command be more specific to only find the unique occurrence.So yeah, this is my journey figuring out this challenge, hope you learn something from this and thank you for your time to read about this writeup."

    "content": "New SeriesThis is a new series where I go over how I learn linux by completing each level of challenge on OverTheWire, this being done by me because I still feels my Linux skill still shallow and needed improvement and enter Bandit OverTheWire. Shoutout to the OverTheWire team once again for this useful learning. Let’s get straight in to the writeup.Small DisclaimerWhy did I start on level 6 tho??? Welp simple, I just recently came to realization to make write up to document my learning when I at level 6, so yeah, in short, I forgor.Level 6 → Level 7For the challenge of this level we’re being tasked as below.Level 6 TaskIt’s quite simple, the way I approach this to first go to the linux manual that is in the task page. And I choose find command manual page, because I think find is a correct way to search for this kind of task. And in the manual page, I got this clue to find the password for this level. Here’s the clue below.So now that I understand I could use the command like that, I could now use the command like this on the picture below.find -type f -size 1033cI could now go for level 7.Level 7 → Level 8Level 7 TaskAt first, I tried to do this to “check the waters” and see what kind of challenge I’m facing.Phew… it is indeed a lot, and the fact that the task tasking us to search for the specific it’s specific users and in the whole server too…. But oh well, let’s get to it.But first, I’m asking ChatGPT to refresh my understanding what is “owned by user” and “owned by group” meant. Were they permissions? Were they some kind of system tags? And how did numbers like 664 or 777 fit into all of this?Okay…. my understanding up until now was aligned with ChatGPT, the file that we want to searched was belong to bandit7 as the owner but it also belong to group of user in the bandit6. But what I still don’t understand is that, why this connected to 664 or 777 or 731 etc, because when I back then learned linux, I know this things connected to each other but at this point I still confused about them. And how would I know who is bandit7 and bandit6? I still don’t quite get it past these concept. That is why I first tried this command below.find / -type f -perm 664 &amp;&amp; ls -alMy initial thought was that, “how about I combined find command with ls with” AND operand but oh well, looks I was wrong and now, I plan to go back to the fundamental and try to understand what is the differences with users group and those numbers thingies. So, I asked ChatGPT again, here’s what it helped understand by it’s prompt.Oh okay, now I understand, the users group are who have authorization over the files, and the numbers thingies are permission, it means what kind of operation and interaction that were allowed. Oh… okay then.. but I couldn’t help to notice when I tried command ls -al there’s this line in the picture below, that is drwxr-xr-x and lrwxrwxrwx. What are they?I got curious by the l and d but turns out it means:      d = directory (can contain files, “execute” means you can enter it).        l = symbolic link (like a shortcut), and its permissions (rwxrwxrwx) don’t actually matter — the target’s permissions do.  That was good to know, but back to the mission.I then tried this command to once again test my understanding.find / -type f -size 33c | ls -alSounds reasonable right, pipe operator for connecting the input and output command… but nope. Looking back with more search, and many ChatGPT later, I could conclude on why it failed:  | sends the output of find to the standard input of ls.  But ls doesn’t read from stdin like that — it expects file names as arguments.  So I basically piped text into a command that wasn’t listening for it.And after some digging on the internet and ChatGPT, I found a proper way to do it and that isfind / -type f -size 33c 2&gt;/dev/null | xargs ls -alThis is a new things for me to learn, because:      xargs collects the paths from find and passes them to ls -al in batches (faster).        Still hides “Permission denied” errors with 2&gt;/dev/null(sending it to the black hole or berserk eclipse).  With that command I just discovered, I then tried it and here’s the result.And it worked! But as you can see it’s still rough but I could still find it manually after some scrolling and here’s the answer below.And with that, here’s the answer for level 7.And finally level 7 done…. But after learning more, I could make it more specific and efficient instead of searching it manually and here’s the command for it.find / -type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -exec ls -al {} \\; 2&gt;/dev/nullThe more effective command is to:  Add -exec to tell the find command to execute another command and that is ls.  {} acting as place holder for the ls.  And finally \\; to make find command knows where to end the -exec flag command.And that’s it for level 7, see you for the next level in the next write up!."

    "content": "Chapter 7: DictionariesAnother week, another learning journal and this time I’m learning Dictionaries, the part where I will spent most of time to comprehend it(as of time writing this, I’ve already spent roughly 15 days to just understand the basic and fundamental of it, I know, skill issue from my side. But I’ll just write it nonetheless kek…). You will see a lot of “headbanging my head to wall” just to understand this part.But why am I spending most of my time trying to understand this part? Because in my work as Jr. SOC, I’ve seen one of my colleague making automation script for SIEM(ELK Stack), and in his script, it was written with Python and I see the codes more closer, his Python codes most of the time use dictionary and list. This really struck me deep and making me think “Welp looks like I can’t rush this part until I really understand it” And thus begin my trial and error journey of Python dictionaries.Welcome to Dictionarieshuft……….. So let’s just start, at first glance dictionaries appear to be somewhat “easy” for me personally. You initialize it and put some values inside it, what could possibly hard about that?? Right?? Welp, sike, the part where I don’t really understand this chapter lies in how to called and processed the items/values inside of it.But at first, what is Dictionaries in Python? From the book it defines it as “dictionaries are data structuresthat indexes values by a given key (key-value pairs)”. So from that definition we could assume that we need those key for accessing it. Sounds simple in theory but when I tried solving the task for the first, I got my ass humbled quick. Here’s how my attempts looked like.Exercises with dictionariesExercises With Dictionaries SectionFor the first part, we see that we have 4 exercises/task that revolved around given dictionary that is ages. In this dictionaryis bunch of ages from various students. So without further a do, let’s start by task number 1, finding how many students in the dictionary.  My first attempt for task number one is this.ages = {\"Peter\": 10,\"Isabel\": 11,\"Anna\": 9,\"Thomas\": 10,\"Bob\": 10,\"Joseph\": 11,\"Maria\": 12,\"Gabriel\": 10,}for names in ages.items():    print(len(names))Task Number 1 First Attempt OutputIn here, my goofy ass thinking that, “Oh maybe because I was learning loop previously and combining it with .items() to check each items inside the dictionary that I also needed it now to check each of the items inside right? Welp, let’s do the looping then”.That was what I previously thought of it, but as you can see, it is indeed looping each items inside the dictionary but the length that it counted were the length of each items. Where in this case, each items containing two values, the name and age of the students.So, you guess it, I asked ChatGPT for what is wrong here, did I misunderstood something? or what? And here is ChatGPT response.ChatGPT Suggestion For Number 1And turns out I am indeed misunderstood the assignment, and that I don’t need to loop through each items inside it because all I need to do just count the key of the dictionaries……… Because again, dictionary consist of key and values. And the key represent the values also, so in this case we could just straight using len() function.So with that, this is how my second attempts for number 1.print(len(names))Task Number 1 Second Attempt OutputWith this change, the function just counting the keys within dictionary and the result was 8 keys or 8 students in that dictionary. Whew…. this is just number 1 from many trial and error of me in this chapter and there will be a lot of it, so let’s resume to the next task and see what kind of slop that I made lol.  We now move on to number two where we got assigned to calculate the average ages of students contained there. Here’s my first attempt.ages = {\"Peter\": 10,\"Isabel\": 11,\"Anna\": 9,\"Thomas\": 10,\"Bob\": 10,\"Joseph\": 11,\"Maria\": 12,\"Gabriel\": 10,}def agesAverage(x):    for age in ages.items():        return sum(age)    str(agesAverage(ages))The output of that is an error messages like this one below.Task Number 2 First Attempt OutputOkay, as you can see, those code above is my first attempt to make rough code sketch of this task. Because I was at first didn’t quite catch it, my initial thought was that, I first needed to defining function that accepting a variable, then use loop that checks every items in that dictionary and returning it with after done sums it up. Here at the return line, I forgot to make calculation of dividing it with the length of the dictionary.And finally my initial thought was that I needed to convert it to string before I was able to make shows up on the terminal. And as you can see from the error messages, I got all wrong. The message clear state that it’s unsupported operand type for a string and integer to be paired with(if my wording is correct, but cmiiw).But now I can clearly see on what and I’m where I’m wrong, I can now proceed to my second attempt. But a little bit about context as to why my second attempt would be error like that is because I was using this section when reading it from official Python documentation of dictionary.References For Number 2 Second AttemptIn my dumbo understanding, you needed to declare variables in order to accessing the values, which is not true, you could just call .values() function, but,  this is when I was still in the dark about what is dictionary. And based on that, here’s my second attempt.ages = {\"Peter\": 10,\"Isabel\": 11,\"Anna\": 9,\"Thomas\": 10,\"Bob\": 10,\"Joseph\": 11,\"Maria\": 12,\"Gabriel\": 10,}name = ages.name()age = ages.age()def agesAverage(x):    x = 0    for x in age:        x += age        return xagesAverage(ages)And here’s the output of my second attempt.Task Number 2 Second Attempt OutputYeah… when I look back at this attempt of mine, I can’t help but to wonder, “WTF did I just wrote?! Am I acoustic or just drunk or stupid or all of it….” And yes, this is so fucking cringe, wtf did I think to just straight up calling .name() and .age()? Where in God’s green earth I initialize that? The reference clearly state .values() but oh well, I guess I just pass that phase now because I’m a bit more understand dictionary compared to when I made this mess.So, without other options left, I once again asked ChatGPT about what is wrong there, and here’s what ChatGPT says about my horrendous code.Task Number 2 Clues From ChatGPTOkay… I somewhat got a better understand of it, so basically I need to loop through each of items that contained inside, declaring an empty integer type variable so that it could be filled with number that being added, and finally dividing all of those total number with the length i.e. how much numbers contained in the dictionary. Welp sounds alright, let’s see how I done this on my third attempt.def agesAverage(x):    totalAge= 0    for name, age in ages.items():        totalAge += age    average= totalAge / len(ages)    return averageprint(agesAverage(ages))Task Number 2 Third Attempt OutputAnd now we’re talking, the suggestion working perfectly and showing the correct answer. Oh and one thing to note on linefor name, age in ages.items(): you could see variable name on the loop is not being used anywhere but why is it still necessary to be put there? Well, this is the thing that I discover when I was playing around with the suggestion of ChatGPT. I’m thinking, how about if I just put one variable on the loop? I mean I just wanted the ages(numbers/integers), it can be just called if we declared only one variable right? Sike! here’s my code and what Python say about that wishful thinking of me.def agesAverage(x):    totalAge= 0    for age in ages.items():        totalAge += age    average= totalAge / len(ages)    return averageprint(agesAverage(ages))What if you wanted to use one variable but Python said…..And it’s an error, well what I read on the internet is that this happen because incompatibility between tuple(a collection of items or values) being processed directly with an integer data type. So, when I tried digging more information on the internet, I came up with conclusion that the name variable is needed because something is needed to contain the tuple/keys of the dictionary before someone could accessing values. And with it, we should use variable for that task so that the values could be accessed.We almost done with number 2 but when I check that answer to ChatGPT, to my surprise, it suggesting me I could change my code to this to be more effective. And that is instead of using directly the ages dictionary directly, we could just use the x parameter that being passed on the function and the code would be look like this.def agesAverage(x):    totalAge = 0    for name, age in x.items():        totalAge += age    average = totalAge / len(x)    return averageprint(agesAverage(ages))Voila! Our code not wasting any variable and more efficient. I think that is all from me for number 2, let’s move to number 3.  Now, we’re arrived to task where I struggle and I attempt so many codes and logics on this number, and it still baffles me how much of a goofball I’m lol. This task assigning me to find oldest student in the dictionary, at first I was thinking “Well, how hard could it be? It’s just if else comparisons” and oh sweet summer child… So, please enjoy this many slop codes that I made lmao.Oh, I made this part just showing code and no output screenshot, in my opinion because of the amount of trial and error, showing screenshot of each attempt would make this journal too long for just showing a slop code that bound to fail, so I just made the output and the code shows together.# Attempt 1def oldestStudent(x):    oldestAge = age[0]     for name, age in ages.items():        if age &gt; oldestAge:            oldestAge = age    print(f\"The oldest student is: {name}\")    return oldestAgeoldestStudent(ages)→ Output:line , in &lt;module&gt;oldestStudent(ages)oldestAge = age[0]                ^^^UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'age' where it is not associated with a value# Attempt 2def oldestStudent(x):    x = ages[0]    for name, age in ages.items():        if age &gt; x:            x = age    print(f\"The oldest student is: {name}\")    return xoldestStudent(ages)→ Output:ine  , in &lt;module&gt;    oldestStudent(ages)oldestStudent    x = ages[0]# Attempt 3def oldestStudent(x):    oldestAge = x[ages[\"Peter\"]]    for name, age in ages.items():        if age &gt; oldestAge:            oldestAge = age            print(f\"The oldest student is: {name}\")    return oldestAgeoldestStudent(ages)→ Output:line , in &lt;module&gt;    oldestStudent(ages)in oldestStudent    oldestAge = x[ages[\"Peter\"]]                ~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^KeyError: 10## Attempt 4def oldestStudent(oldestAge):    oldestAge = ages['Peter']    for name, age in ages.items():        if age &gt; oldestAge:            oldestAge = age    print(f\"The oldest student is: {name}\")    return oldestAgeoldestStudent(ages)→ Output:The oldest student is: Gabriel ## Hah!, now it's outputting something, but I think the ## return is on the outside of the function and that is why it's only ## showing Gabriel which is not true, this is because my guess is that ## function outputting it outside of the loop making only the last value that being shows.## And in this code, I compared oldestAge variable which the same being the age of## Peter and that way Peter could served as comparisons to find the oldest age. But## As you can see, it doesn't work that way so there's that.# Attempt 5def oldestStudent(oldestAge):    oldestAge = ages['Peter']    for name, age in ages.items():        if age &gt; oldestAge:            oldestAge = age            return nameprint(oldestStudent(ages))→ Output:Isabel## Now, I tried to see what happened if I placed the return inside the loop and## turns out it's working yes, but it stopped when it find already biggest number## than Peter age(10) and that is Isabel.

This is not the answer we want, so after this, I consult to ChatGPT## as to what am I missing lol.With that being said, the tips given by ChatGPT.Hints From ChatGPT For Finding Oldest AgeAs you can see, the hints suggesting changing return position to outside again, initializing variable to save the name of the oldest student as an empty variable with data type of string, and lastly, this is the crucial part, I need to declare that the oldestAge and oldestName is the same with name and age from the dictionary.So what it mean from my understanding is that you first declared age is 0 → and the loop happen → it start checking the dictionary → code begin comparing age which is 0 at the start → then because the first age it encounter is Peter age(10), we saved that again as the new value of age and as well because it contained the name we also save it again to the oldestName variable → and this keep looping until the last value of the ages dictionary → after the loop done, the loop then return the oldestName as the result of the comparison that just happen in the loop operation.def oldestStudent(students):    oldestAge = 0    oldestName = \"\"    for name, age in students.items():        if age &gt; oldestAge:            oldestAge = age            oldestName = name    return oldestNameprint(oldestStudent(ages))I feeling so dumb when not realizing that you only just need to declared inside the loop that the oldestAge = age, and the fact that I also think that you wouldn’t need to save name variable because the age already there. I just start face palm but oh well, part of learning is that realize how cringe and stupid you’re before you have the knowledge. But we still have many more goofy stuff ahead of us, so let’s go to the next number 4!  For task number 4, we’ve been tasked to return new dictionary where that new dictionary contain a specific age of student that you wanted to search, for example new_ages(ages,10) returns a copy of ages where each student is 10 years older.But this is where I misunderstood that this task wanted me to add 10 to the students ages and not searching age of students that equal to 10 🤦(silly me). But well, here’s what this dum dum made below.def oldestStudent(newStudentDict):    ageTenStudents= {}    studentName= \"\"    studentAge= 0    for name, age in newStudentDict.items():        if age == 10:            name == studentName            age == studentAge    return ageTenStudentsprint(oldestStudent(ages))→ Output:{}## God.... what the fuck did I think this code will accomplish.... I just## punching air if it's like that.... I didn't adding anything to the ## empty list and just straight up returning empty bag.... ## And yes, I forgot to change the function name lol, I got no excuse## for that other than me being lazy bump.## Attempt 2def oldestStudent(newStudentDict):    ageTenStudents= {}    studentName= \"\"    studentAge= 0    for name, age in newStudentDict.items():        if age == 10:            studentName = name            studentAge = age            ageTenStudents = {studentName, studentAge }    return ageTenStudentsprint(oldestStudent(ages))→ Output:{10, 'Gabriel'}## Lmao... I got to admit, this part is because my half assed understanding ## and my curiosity and yep I kinda surprised this code work in the first## try even though it's wrong lol.So with that, I ask ChatGPT again as to what’s wrong here. First ChatGPT help me clear the misunderstanding by this answer.ChatGPT Help Me To Understand The Task AssignmentNow that I understand it, we then continue to the hints that ChatGPT suggest.Hints From ChatGPT For Solving Task Number 4At this point, I know that:  I was right to define an empty variables for each properties(dictionary, name, age).  I was wrong to understand that you need to find students with age equal of 10 but I need to add 10 for each age of students.  The loop need to add 10 for each of the ages.But also there’s my another misunderstanding from that hints Iwas thingking that dictionary is declared with [] and set is declared {} so I thought “Oh okay, all should do now just add an empty dictionary, add the plus 10 age to it then return the dictionary” so, here’s how my next went.def newStudentDict(newDict):    plusTenAge= []    for name, age in newDict.items():        plusTenAge[name] = age +10    return plusTenAgeprint(newStudentDict(ages))→ Output:in &lt;module&gt;    print(newStudentDict(ages))in newStudentDict    plusTenAge[name] = age +10    ~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not strAnd yep, this really confuses me previously, because I thought huh? I thought “why the incompatibility? I thought dictionary was [] and the list is {}” so yep, time to ask ChatGPT(yet again…… lol) to clear up how and where did I wrong.Clearing Misunderstanding of What Is List vs DictionaryOkay, now this really confuses me again because up to this point, from my understanding, I got it switched, so I kinda crash out a bit with ChatGPT as you can see from this picture below.Asking ChatGPT Nicely What Is List vs DictionaryFrom the hints you can see I already solved it but what I wanted to say that, yes, I previously confusing code that looked like this my_set = {\"Peter\", \"Anna\"} with this my_dictionary = {\"Peter\": 10, \"Anna\": 12} and that is because I was so fixed to the idea that set is using curly bracket lol. So, here’s my final code after long trial and error along with many hints from ChatGPT.def newStudentDict(newDict):    plusTenAge= {}    for name, age in newDict.items():        plusTenAge[name] = age +10    return plusTenAgeprint(newStudentDict(ages))Final Attempt OutputWith that, I was learning so much, start from what is exactly dictionary, interacting key and values in dictionary, using Loop to process each values in dictionary. Up next, more learning of dictionary and this is where I was stuck so long learning dictionary because this was so new to me, especially after coming back from not learning programming for 2 years and that is sub-dictionaries. Let’s get into it!Exercises with sub-dictionariesSecond Exercises Section With Sub-dictionariesFor me, this exercises really makes me learning new things a lot because so many things that I thought previous I got it understand turns out to be just straight up wrong and this makes me asking ChatGPT so many times lmao. So, let’s go to the learning and see what things that I still got it wrong.  We start again with exercise number 1 of this section counting how many students on the number 1 dictionary.students = {    \"Peter\": {\"age\": 10, \"address\": \"Lisbon\"},    \"Isabel\": {\"age\": 11, \"address\": \"Sesimbra\"},    \"Anna\": {\"age\": 9, \"address\": \"Lisbon\"},}len(students)→ Output:3Nothing new for task number 1, it’s just we calling len() function and let the function do the rest, so we got 3 as the output. Let’s just get straight into number task two.  Here’s my attempts for task number two that assigning us to search for the average age of the student in the dictionary.## Attempt 1def studentsAvrgAge(x):    totalAge= 0     for name, age in students.items():        age += totalAge        averageAge = totalAge / len(x)    return averageAgeprint(studentsAvrgAge(students))→ Output:in &lt;module&gt;    print(studentsAvrgAge(students))          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^in studentsAvrgAge    age += totalAgeTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +=: 'dict' and 'int'## Attempt 2def studentsAvrgAge(x):    totalAge= 0     for age in students.values():        age += totalAge        averageAge = totalAge / len(x)    return averageAgeprint(studentsAvrgAge(students))→ Output:in &lt;module&gt;    print(studentsAvrgAge(students))in studentsAvrgAge    age += totalAgeTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +=: 'dict' and 'int'On that attempt I only thought that I was just using .values() here wrong, I thought that I needed to use .item(), so then I asked ChatGPT thinking that only that part that I was just wrong. But to my surprised here’s ChatGPT hints.Hints For Fixing Average Age Sub-dictionaryI surprised that my first initial thought of using .values() to interact with the sub-dictionary turns out to be true. Because I think that .item() is used for a single dictionary and that .values() used to interacting what is inside the sub-dictionary. But it is my addition that is wrong, and because of that the code thinking that I operating dictionary with an integer. But as you already know, it’s just wrong and that you need to be specific as to how you accessing it.And that is why ChatGPT suggesting to use age[age] in order for us to be more specific as to what we accessing. That way, we could start operating totalAge with age in the sub-dictionary because the code now knows what values we want to access and it is located in side age sub-dictionary, the one containing an integer.Now we know the necessary information’s to solve this task, here’s how I implement it in my code on this final attempt.def studentsAvrgAge(x):    totalAge= 0     for age in students.values():        age += totalAge        averageAge = totalAge / len(x)    return averageAgeprint(studentsAvrgAge(students))Third Attempt Output of Task Number 2 Average AgeAnd yep, let’s double check on the output just in case using calculator.Okay, The Output Is CorrectNow that task number 2 done, we to final exercise of this section. Let’s get into it.  We got assigned to make function that will return new list if the address being inputted is correct like the example shown in the question. So, wanna see how I make another slops? Without further ado, let’s see it.students = {\"Peter\": {\"age\": 10, \"address\": \"Lisbon\"},\"Isabel\": {\"age\": 11, \"address\": \"Sesimbra\"},\"Anna\": {\"age\": 9, \"address\": \"Lisbon\"},}## Attempt 1def findStudents():    newStudentsList= {}    for name, address in students.values():        if students[address] == students[name]:            return newStudentsListprint(findStudents(students, 'Lisbon'))→ Output:in &lt;module&gt;    print(findStudents(students, 'Lisbon'))          ~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^TypeError: findStudents() takes 0 positional arguments but 2 were given## I don't know why the output stating like that, because at this point## I was still try to grasping the concept of as to how interact with## sub-dictionary values, so I thought just declaring `students[address]`## or something like that would be sufficient. BUt oh well, looks like I'm## just that stupid. So in the next attempt, I tried to put parameter that## will accept anything i.e. using *args if the issue was like what being stated## by the error message. Let's see what will be the output.## Attempt 2def findStudents(*inputAddress):    newStudentsList= {}    for address in students.values():        if inputAddress == address[\"address\"]:            return newStudentsListprint(findStudents(students, 'Lisbon'))→ Output:None## And another wacky attempt..... reading this back, yeah....## what was I thinking returning an empty dictionary, stupid me...## I have no other explanation that I still need better understanding of this## dictionary topics.As you can see, all my attempt is just straight goofy even stupid, and at this point too this learning really taking a toll to me and making feel like really wanted to quit learning Python or programming in general. Because I think that despite learning all of this and already having so much clues being thrown at, I still doesn’t make it clicked in my mind, this whole programming shenanigans.But before I really was about to give up again, I once again asking ChatGPT for another guidance to help me pointing out where did I do wrong. And here’s what it suggest to me for the fixing.ChatGPT Hints For Solving Checking List &amp; Return New ListFrom this prompt you can see I complained a bit to ChatGPT lol, because yeah, to me this problem really makes me wreck my brain and really challenges my understanding for this stuff. The function .values() the one that I thought correct because I need to only check the sub-dictionary turns out wrong because I was still need to check all of the stuff in the whole dictionary.The *args variable that I thought could be solution for accepting all type of data is wrong too, because it turns the input into tuple. And don’t forget the {} vs [] differences, stuff like this really makes me confused. And what’s boggles my mind is that, the overall rough logic of my second attempt is somewhat close enough, and only wrongs in my attempt was just how I calling stuffs, and some forgotten mentioning function. But overall it really close enough…..But yeah, here’s my last attempt after being given the hints.def findStudents(studentDict, address):    newStudentsList= []    for name, info in studentDict.items():        if info[\"address\"] == address :            newStudentsList.append(name)    return newStudentsListprint(findStudents(students, 'Lisbon'))Final Attempt Output For Solving Task Number 3And with that I finally solved all of the task available for the Dictionary chapter from the book, but I feel this is somewhat not enough, so I return to ChatGPT and asked it why this code worked and all of my previous attempt failed. And here’s what it prompted me.ChatGPT Helps Me Explaining The Logic of Why Previous Code WorkedAnd yeah, I still complaining because I just thought to myself back then at this point that I just that stupid to not even understand this and asked ChatGPT if I just give up because I previously give up programming too but then ChatGPT says not to and saying that I just need to see that you should learn the why that it shows on the picture above.So from it’s suggestion, ChatGPT saying my code gives tuple not a string and that I need change {} to [], use proper comparisons with pointing to correct variable i.e. info[\"address\"] that is because I that way it could properly loop through the dictionary first and after that start the comparison unlike my code where it just compare first and then do the loop(I got it switched).I also need to add the value after comparison in which that I not do it on my attempts. I just straight returning an empty list, and lastly, to make the code checked everything on the dictionary I should use .items() and not .values(). That way I could check the entirety and not just the sub-dictionary when doing this kind of function.Last but not least, some advice from ChatGPT.Advices From ChatGPTExtra dictionary &amp; sub-dictionary exercisesAnd from that advices what leads us to this section of this learning journal. In this section, I want to try more exercises generated from ChatGPT and challenge myself to what I still lacking and what stuff I should understand more and where my misunderstanding is. That way I could confidently move on to the next chapter of this book, Classes. Because when I see what kind of thing classes is, I just thought “yep, I gotta strengthening my understanding first before tackling such material.”Let’s what exercises ChatGPT generated for me and also let’s try to solve it! Here’s the first exercise.First Challenge ExerciseOkay, so this is the first exercise from the custom challenge, it assigning us to group the students by their age. In technical terms, return a new dictionary where the keys i.e. age and the values are names. So it switch places and with some extra sorting.Welp, that’s about it for the first exercise, let’s see my first attempt below.students = {    \"Peter\": 10,    \"Isabel\": 11,    \"Anna\": 9,    \"Thomas\": 10,    \"Bob\": 10,    \"Joseph\": 11,    \"Maria\": 12,    \"Gabriel\": 10,}def studentAgeGroup(studentDict):    newGroup= []    for name, age in studentDict.items():        newGroup.sort()        newGroup.append(age)    return newGroupprint(studentAgeGroup(students))→ Output:[9, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12, 10]So I got the age sorted but no name being displayed…. It’s just goofy and silly at the same time seeing me this back again but then what this losers do when he couldn’t comprehend something like this? Yep, ask the AI again to help him braining. So here’s what ChatGPT says what my error and wrongs really mean.Clues For DumbassFor the clue, what I got right was that loop through each of the value using .items() and I somewhat have the right call to declared variable that will hold the value, like a list or something. But what I still got wrong was that, {} is what you need not [](I still confusing the two of them at this point). And something that ChatGPT suggest to look for was that how to exactly group them and not using .sort() function. Because you could do it without it only using conditional statement.And what ChatGPT by that is on second clues above. I still didn’t understand how to use this kind of code some_list[...] to specifying that I need to loop up inside of the dictionary like that. So yeah, ChatGPT already helped me answering it so let’s just test the logic inside of the code.def studentAgeGroup(studentDict):    newGroup= {}    for name, age in studentDict.items():        if age not in newGroup:            newGroup[age] = []        newGroup[age].append(name)    return newGroupprint(studentAgeGroup(students))Second Attempt OutputSo… the code was correct but it kinda leaves me doubting myself, because up to this point, I still need to turn back to ChatGPT for solving the task. And leaves me really doubting myself, so I’ll just leaves this whole prompt below to really captures what my worried was really about.But, first, it is indeed me being wheeny whiny about this whole ordeal but I just feels like to put this here for someone just like me that feels the same when learning this kind of stuff. Because it really is that mental draining. Mock me or whatever, but I’ll just leave it here.From those words, I just realized that I just to simply push through this thing, because this is a marathon not a sprint. You have to get good at being so stubborn about this stuffs. So, it came across my mind that I need to do one more section exercise to make it clicked in my mind this whole dictionary thingy. So the next exercise below is from ChatGPT and not the book.Let’s see what this second extra exercise had in store for me. Here’s what the assignment ask us to do.First Extra Task Exercise## First Attemptstudents_scores = {    \"Alice\": {\"Math\": 88, \"Science\": 90, \"History\": 75},    \"Bob\": {\"Math\": 70, \"Science\": 78, \"History\": 85},    \"Charlie\": {\"Math\": 95, \"Science\": 80, \"History\": 70},    \"Dina\": {\"Math\": 60, \"Science\": 65, \"History\": 72}}def calculate_students_average(scores_dictionary):    student_grades = students_scores.values()    student_name = students_scores.keys()    student_sums = 0    avg_grade_student_dict = []    for grade in student_grades:        student_sums += grade    return student_sums / len(students_scores)print(calculate_students_average(students_scores))→ Output:line 18, in &lt;module&gt;    print(calculate_students_average(students_scores))in calculate_students_average    student_sums += gradeTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +=: 'int' and 'dict'Let’s see what I still got it wrongs, it is with the .values() and .items() here, also the calculation logics too, well because mostly I’m still confused by the whole of it, so I just asked ChatGPT again for tips.And I get it from this onward, and yeah, here’s how I fix it.def calculate_avg_students_score(students_score):    students_top_avg = 0    top_students_name = \"\"    for students_name, students_grade in students_score.items():        avg_grade = sum(students_grade.values()) / len(students_grade)        if avg_grade &gt; students_top_avg:            students_top_avg = avg_grade            top_students_name = students_name    return f\"Student: {top_students_name} with the average {students_top_avg}\"print(calculate_avg_students_score(students))Correct Output For My Second AttemptSo with confusion in my mind about .values() and .items() and as to why my code fails, I asked ChatGPT again to clear things up and here’s what it answer me.Some More ExplanationOkay, now I kinda get it, but for now, I take a short break after solving this task. I somewhat feels a bit burned out so I take some good rest for one day and back again to solving another exercise. But this time, I asked ChatGPT to make the difficulty become more increasing gradually.For this section, I’ll just speed running it, as this journal already gone far too long lol.Another Extra Exercises For Understanding DictionaryOkay, now I’ve another exercises being prompted, let’s just get into it and see what slops attempt I made and what learning I could gained from solving this.  For level 1, it’s quite easy because I just simply printing string and calling the right function.books = {    \"1984\": \"George Orwell\",    \"Dune\": \"Frank Herbert\",    \"The Hobbit\": \"J.R.R. Tolkien\",    \"Brave New World\": \"Aldous Huxley\"}def printing_book():    for book_title, book_author in books.items():        return f\"{book_title} was written by {book_author}\"    print(printing_book())Or if you feels fancy, ChatGPT also could suggesting something like this.def printing_book():    output = \"\"    for book_title, book_author in books.items():        output += f\"{book_title} was written by {book_author}\\n\"    return outputprint(printing_book())  Unto level 2, here’s what my attempt looks like.fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\", \"apple\"]def counting_fruits(fruit_basket):    for fruit in fruit_basket.items():        if fruit == fruit_basket.values():            print()That is my rough attempt for solving level 2, so I kinda get the logic but I still feel like missing something on it, so I asked ChatGPT for hints.So, I get it now, I missed to declare new dictionary, the comparison is somewhat correct but just missed on the checking and I don’t need the .items() function. So with it, here’s what my second attempt.fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\", \"apple\"]def counting_fruits(fruit_basket):    new_basket = {}    for fruit in fruit_basket:        if fruit in new_basket:            new_basket[fruit] += 1        else:            new_basket[fruit] = 1    return new_basketprint(counting_fruits(fruits))  This one next is my attempts solving level 3, so here it is.scores = {    \"Alice\": 84,    \"Bob\": 91,    \"Charlie\": 67,    \"Dina\": 91}def find_highest_score(scoreboard):    highest_score= 0     player_name= \"\"    for player_name, player_score in scoreboard.items():        if player_score &gt; highest_score:            print(\"Highest score is \", highest_score, \"by: \", player_name)print(find_highest_score(scores))→ Output:Highest score is  0 by:  AliceHighest score is  0 by:  BobHighest score is  0 by:  CharlieHighest score is  0 by:  DinaNoneOkay, so for this first attempt, I wanted to test the water and see where my initial logic wrong, and from this I could see and guess that I wrongly calling the variable loop name, the comparison is also basically just comparing the students score with 0, so of course it always shows it as the biggest number.And lastly in my guess I need the return because that output still showing none. So once again I checked my wrong on ChatGPT and see what it thinks about my guess.Looks like ChatGPT thinking the same thing with me. Let’s solving this now shall we?scores = {    \"Alice\": 84,    \"Bob\": 91,    \"Charlie\": 67,    \"Dina\": 91}def find_highest_score(scoreboard):    highest_score= 0     top_player= \"\"    for player_name, player_score in scoreboard.items():        if player_score &gt; highest_score:            highest_score = player_score            top_player = player_name    return(\"Highest score is\", highest_score, \"by:\", top_player)print(find_highest_score(scores))And the level 3 done, but ChatGPT had also some advices that could improve my code that my line below.return(\"Highest score is\", highest_score, \"by:\", top_player)It’s returning a tuple, in which is correct logically but a little bit messy. So here’s the suggested fix.return f\"Highest score is {highest_score} by: {top_player}\"Now it will print output appropriately. We then move to level 4 exercise.  For number 4, my attempt looks like this. This attempt inspired by my first attempt in the level 3 exercise.students = {    \"Alice\": {\"Math\": 90, \"Science\": 85},    \"Bob\": {\"Math\": 70, \"Science\": 80},    \"Charlie\": {\"Math\": 85, \"Science\": 95}}def calculate_avg_students_score(students_score):    students_top_avg= 0    top_students_name= \"\"    for students_name, students_grade in students_score.items():        avg_grade= sum(students_grade.values()/len(students_grade))        if students_grade &gt; students_top_avg:            students_top_avg = students_grade            top_students_name = students_name    return f\"Student: {top_students_name} with the average {avg_grade}\"print(calculate_avg_students_score(students))→ Output:in &lt;module&gt;    print(calculate_avg_students_score(students))in calculate_avg_students_score    avg_grade= sum(students_grade.values()/len(students_grade))                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'dict_values' and 'int'Okay… so it’s kinda wrong on the data type, so let me ask ChatGPT again for the hints again, because I kinda get it now a little bit but I notice I always lacking on the handling data. So here’s what ChatGPT suggest me.And finally here’s my final attempt after following the hints from ChatGPT.students = {    \"Alice\": {\"Math\": 90, \"Science\": 85},    \"Bob\": {\"Math\": 70, \"Science\": 80},    \"Charlie\": {\"Math\": 85, \"Science\": 95}}def calculate_avg_students_score(students_score):    all_averages = {}    students_top_avg = 0    top_students_name = \"\"    average_class_score = 0    for students_name, students_grade in students_score.items():        avg_grade = sum(students_grade.values()) / len(students_grade)        all_averages[students_name] = avg_grade  # save each average        if avg_grade &gt; students_top_avg:            students_top_avg = avg_grade            top_students_name = students_name        average_class_score += avg_grade        class_avg = average_class_score / len(students_score)    return all_averages, f\"Top student: {top_students_name} with avg {students_top_avg}\", class_avgall_avg, top, avg = calculate_avg_students_score(students)print(\"All Averages:\", all_avg)print(\"The top student is:\", top)print(\"And the class average is:\", avg)And that’s it, but I asked ChatGPT as to why I’m getting error float object is not iterable when I tried use sum() on the avg_grade variable. Because I thought you would just sums it up all, but ChatGPT told me that sum() only work on list and anything similar to that and if you use raw number it wouldn’t work. So instead, ChatGPT suggesting this code below for my initial logic.students = {    \"Alice\": {\"Math\": 90, \"Science\": 85},    \"Bob\": {\"Math\": 70, \"Science\": 80},    \"Charlie\": {\"Math\": 85, \"Science\": 95}}def calculate_avg_students_score(students_score):    all_averages = {}    students_top_avg = 0    top_students_name = \"\"    for students_name, students_grade in students_score.items():        avg_grade = sum(students_grade.values()) / len(students_grade)        all_averages[students_name] = avg_grade  # save each average        if avg_grade &gt; students_top_avg:            students_top_avg = avg_grade            top_students_name = students_name    # Now we calculate the class average correctly    class_average = sum(all_averages.values()) / len(all_averages)    return all_averages, f\"Top student: {top_students_name} with avg {students_top_avg}\", class_averageall_avg, top, class_average_score = calculate_avg_students_score(students)print(\"All Averages:\", all_avg)print(\"The top student is:\", top)print(\"And the class average is:\", class_average_score)So in here we use .values() again but it’s on the new dictionary that we just declared. Okay, let’s move on to the last level.  Lastly, level 5 is where I tried this logic first and then asking ChatGPT about what’s am I missed from this. Because this is just my first initial thought.employees = {    \"Alice\": \"Engineering\",    \"Bob\": \"HR\",    \"Charlie\": \"Engineering\",    \"Dina\": \"Marketing\",    \"Eve\": \"HR\"}def sorting_employees(employees_position):    employees_books = {}    for employees_name, employees_division in employees_position.items():        if employees_books[employees_division] == employees_books[employees_name]:I stopped on the conditional line because this is where I sense something wrong. And yes, when I asked ChatGPT what is wrong on my initial logic, it pointed to my condition logic and suggesting me to put it like this.if division not in employees_books:    employees_books[division] = []employees_books[division].append(name)That not in is all I needed to know where I got it wrong, and after that clue, here’s my final code.employees = {    \"Alice\": \"Engineering\",    \"Bob\": \"HR\",    \"Charlie\": \"Engineering\",    \"Dina\": \"Marketing\",    \"Eve\": \"HR\"}def sorting_employees(employees_position):    employees_books = {}    for employees_name, employees_division in employees_position.items():        if employees_division not in employees_books:            employees_books[employees_division] = []        employees_books[employees_division].append(employees_name)    return employees_booksprint(sorting_employees(employees))And……….. that’s it! I finally completed this journal. Whew, such a long journey. I just wanted to say thank you for reading all of this bullshit. And if you learning something from this crap, I’m really humbled and glad for that. Thank you again and see you on the next learning journal."

    "content": "Chapter 6: Iteration and LoopsBack again with another Python learning journal, with learning topic of iteration &amp; looping in Python language. This chapter is the important fundamental of every programming language including Python. Because with with it, we are able to tell the computer to iterate each values, enabling us to automate repetitive tasks.For Python, the most common looping iteration would be either for and while. But before we dive more into the exercises, what is exactly those two means? Are they different? When to know their best usage? Here’s the explanation.      for LoopThis form of looping used when you want to loop over something with a defined structure to iterate over all of items of a list, range, string, etc.        while LoopThe looping mechanic that you used when you don’t know how many times the loop would be i.e. not having any structured but you just know that the loop needed to continue until the condition reach false at the of the loop. But until then, the loop continues if still return true.        for vs while?          You Use for loop when you know how many steps or items you want to go through.      while loop is used when you don’t know in advance how many times the loop will run.      The loop continues as long as the condition is true with while loop. If the condition never turns false, it loops forever.      for loop is clean, predictable, and fits well with lists, ranges, files, etc.      Alrighty then, the theory part was done explained, now for the challenging stuff, the exercises. Starter exercises on this chapter is exercises using for loop. Let’s jump right into it.DisclaimerOn this part of my journalizing my Python learning journey, you will notice the change of naming variable format fromname_of_variable → nameOfVariableThis changes is for me to see what would the code be look like if I use my style back when I was still coding Kotlin(camelCase style), and I also know Python had their own format called snake_case where you could read more about it here. So……… I kinda sorry for making some eyes hurt when reading this and also at the same time not sorry because I just want to experiment and as per my knowledge this is my attempt to document my leanring, especially the error, the wrong, and the right of my learning. So bear with me for this chapter lol.Exercises with the for loopFor Loop ExercisesFor loop having 7 tasks really surprises me here. It really emphasizes the important of this loop in Python language, but with this we could discover and learn so many things of this particular looping method. So let’s start with number 1 and that is loop that sums all elements inside the list.Below is my first attempt solving number 1.First Attempt Number 1 For Loop ExercisesAs you can see from that wacky logic of mine there’s some silliest stuff that I tried to do, such as:  I tried to userList.append() what is this mean after I search on internet and ChatGPT is that, I just only adding one input and making the list only has one number.  I missed to put function parameter there for accepting various input of values.  The return print(sums) is simply the goofiest of them, what the hell am I thinking back then. Do I need to return it or just print it immediately…..And with that in mind ChatGPT also give me some advice such as:  Investigate: input().split() and explore how you can use .split() and int() inside a loop or comprehension to convert space-separated input into integers.  Explore: for number in my_list:  Think about the difference between print() and returnAnd those advices makes something clicked in my mind. I just remember I’ve done how to input values into comprehension list, so why not use that? And also parameter? Yeah, I remember *args that accepting multiple values and I also remember split() used to separate spaces right…. Welp looks like it’s coming together… and this is how attempt my next code.def addFunction(*integer):    sums=0    for x in integer:        sums += x    print(sums)userInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [float(x) for x in userInputList.split()]addFunction(numberList)Just as I thought I finally got it the output once again surprises me. Here’s the output below.Second Attempt Output Number 1 For Loop ExercisesWell I guess it’s not easy huh, what else do I expect ppfftt. Okay, so what’s wrong here? Why it’s invalid? What exactly invalid literal for int() with base 10: mean? So I searched it on internet and I stumbled upon this stackoverflow post.Clue For Number 1 For Loop Exercises Huh, interesting so it’s rather a format differences and the value could not be parsed. I started to think…. If it’s the value differences…. Maybe I got it wrong on initializing it on the parameter of the function? How about I just change it without * symbol? Maybe it could be working….”. So with that, I made a change just to erased the * on the function parameter.def addFunction(integer):    sums=0    for x in integer:        sums += x    print(sums)userInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [float(x) for x in userInputList.split()]addFunction(numberList)And the moment of truth…. Let’s see how’s the output would look like.Second Attempt Number 1 For Loop Exercises And exactly as my guess previously… what a nice feeling when your guess turns out to be true in programming. It’s just so addicting lol, but ngl the stress is really overwhelming too but hey, at least it’s correct in the end.Oh and also why this one is correct because I give the function what it exactly expecting, a single list of numbers, but why it expecting single list now than before? Well it’s because this symbol * or the name is wildcard, it’s basically telling computer to expect any values but with a catch of multiple of it, so because I’m working with list, the computer expecting me to input multiple of list with that wildcard. Where if I don’t use that wildcard, it just expecting one list.Okay…. now that task number one is done, unto number 2 then. Here’s how I first approaching it with my rough sketch of code. This is me trying to figure it out, so there will be a lot of attempt of me failing to realize the correct code, so bear with me lol.def biggerThanFunction(integer):    index=0    for x in integer:        indexPointer= index + x        if  x &gt; indexPointer:            print(f\"The biggest number on the list is: {x}\")        return xuserInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [float(x) for x in userInputList.split()]biggerThanFunction(numberList)First Attempt Maximum Value OutputAnd as you can see, my first attempt doesn’t even printing the output lol, so, I asked again ChatGPT as to why this is happening. So, here’s what ChatGPT hinting to me to fix my code.Hints For Fixing Maximum Value LoopWhew… that’s a lot of hints, but mainly the reason why first attempt looked like that(it’s an abomination indeed) because:  I think it’s necessary to plus the index with the x in order to make it saved the value and comparing it for later usage.  I thought the use of return can only be done inside the loop.  I thought the value would just be saved automatically even without me declaring variable.  And I also thought that printing the result can only be be done inside the loop too.That my initials thought when coding it but turns out ChatGPT clearing my misunderstanding of it and now I have somewhat rough understanding of it because of the given hints. So, with much more clear understanding, then begin my journey to tweak my code here and there lol, ladies and gentleman, I present to you, my dumbass just finding the correct output.#Attempt 1def biggerThanFunction(integer):    index=0    for x in integer:        if x &gt;= index:            print(f\"The biggest number on the list is: {x}\")userInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [float(x) for x in userInputList.split()]biggerThanFunction(numberList)→Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5The biggest number on the list is: 1.0The biggest number on the list is: 2.0The biggest number on the list is: 3.0The biggest number on the list is: 4.0The biggest number on the list is: 5.0## This code is just straight up a wacky crap, where is always true ## because the comparison is zero(from index = 0) and that is why every number ## in the list is always bigger and making the function always printing.#Attempt 2def biggerThanFunction(integer):    index=0    for x in integer:        if x &gt; index:            index = x            print(f\"The biggest number on the list is: {x}\")        return xuserInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [float(x) for x in userInputList.split()]biggerThanFunction(numberList)→Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5The biggest number on the list is: 1.0## Yep, now I kinda get it now, the return should be outside... ## But now the logic still wrong because the comparison still the same with 0 but ## it stops at the first value. #Attempt 3def biggerThanFunction(integer):    index=integer[0]    for x in integer:        if x &gt; index:            index = x            print(f\"The biggest number on the list is: {x}\")    return xuserInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [int(x) for x in userInputList.split()]biggerThanFunction(numberList)→Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5The biggest number on the list is: 2The biggest number on the list is: 3The biggest number on the list is: 4The biggest number on the list is: 5## Okay this is getting interesting, the output is correctly comparing each values inside the list ## but the catch here is that the list keep going on and on printing the output ## where it should've been just output one value.#Attempt 4def biggerThanFunction(integer):    index=integer[0]    while integer &gt; index:        print(f\"The biggest number in the list is {integer}\")userInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [int(x) for x in userInputList.split()]biggerThanFunction(numberList)→line 79, in biggerThanFunction    while integer &gt; index:          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^TypeError: '&gt;' not supported between instances of 'list' and 'int'line 79, in biggerThanFunction    while integer &gt; index:          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^TypeError: '&gt;' not supported between instances of 'list' and 'int'##Yeah, this one is just straight up wrong. This code is just me experimenting with while loop. ##The next attempt will be back using for loop.#Attempt 5def biggerThanFunction(integer):    index=integer[0]    for x in integer:        if x &gt; index:            index = x    print(f\"The biggest number on the list is: {index}\")    return indexuserInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [int(x) for x in userInputList.split()]biggerThanFunction(numberList)→Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: 12 3 45 67 19 20 100The biggest number on the list is: 100## Finally, the correct attempt, this time I testing it with various bigger number to see if the logic got it wrong somewhere but turns out it working correctly. ## Now, from my previous experience with all of the attempt previously, I came to conclusion that ## the positioning is really matter, so in this attempt I move out the print and return to outside of the loop and now the code working correctly. Whew… that is a lot for number two. I’m kinda sorry for you to have witness the bullshit code that I attempted there but I feel like to documenting a lot of my progress here so that I could reflect upon it in the future. Number two done, now let’s solve number 3 task.For number three, here’s how I first approaching the task with this code.def biggerThanPointerFunction(integer):    maxValue=integer[0]    index = enumerate(integer)    for x in integer:        if x &gt; maxValue:            maxValue = x    print(f\"The biggest number on the list is: {maxValue}, {index}\")    return maxValueuserInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [int(x) for x in userInputList.split()]biggerThanPointerFunction(numberList)First Attempt Output of Printing Max Value In The List Along It’s Index PositionOkay…. the logic is just me copying it from the previous task but when I tried to combined printing out index straight in the string whereas index here has been declared as enumerated integer, the position just being showed in hex format and unreadable for humans.So, let’s ask ChatGPT again for some clues that might leads us to the right answer, and here it is below the right answer of it.Hints For Fixing Maximum Value With IndexSo, from the clues, now I know that it is possible to declare two variables in loop. Because previously until now, I just know that you could just use one variable in the loop but now I know that you could use more than one, I will put new variable that could saved and tracked index. I also know from the clues that you could just use enumerate() wrapping the argument with it in the loop.The last clue pointing that I still not save and track index. This because as I said, I don’t know you could just use more than one variable of for loop in Python. Okay, now that the misunderstanding and mistake has been corrected and given hints, I tried my best to make the code. And here’s my result of it.def biggerThanPointerFunction(integer):    maxValue=integer[0]    maxIndex = 0    for x, value in enumerate(integer):        if value &gt; maxValue:            maxValue = value            maxIndex = x    print(f\"The biggest number on the list is: {maxValue}, at index: {maxIndex}\")    return maxValueuserInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [int(x) for x in userInputList.split()]biggerThanPointerFunction(numberList)Now, the moment of truth, here’s the output.Second Attempt Output of Maximum Value With IndexAnd would you look at that, I got it correct on my second attempts. So the logic here is that we need to point direction correctly, don’t forget to save the value on a variable and lastly, the enumerate is needed because it returns pairs of (index, value) that helped the loop unpack the pairs directly in the loop. And welp…. looks like I’m done for task too, now let’s go tfor task number 4.For number 4, here’s how my first attempt look like. I first try to understand what the task wanted me to do because I’m still confused with the words “keep adding the value in reversed order”, so I asked ChatGPT again for some clearance and here’s what it says.Hints For Solving Task Number 4def reversingListFunction(input):    newList = []    for x in reversed(input):        newList.append(x)    print(\"The revered list is: \", newList)    return newListinputOriginalList = input(\"Input your list to be reversed: \")originalNumberList = [int(x) for x in inputOriginalList.split()]reversingListFunction(inputOriginalList)First Attempt Output Reverse List Number 4As you can see, the function is working properly but there’s some bug there, when I input the list with spaces, the spaces also got counted as part of the list and because of that, it also being reversed alongside the values. So…. I asked ChatGPT again and it pointed out that this line below:reversingListFunction(inputOriginalList)That one line the cause of the bug because I am passing raw string from it where instead I should’ve been passing originalNumberList variable that I just made with .split() function. and here is my code after I fixing it.def reversingListFunction(reversedList):    newList = []    for x in reversed(reversedList):        newList.append(x)    print(f\"The reversed list is: {newList}\")    return newListinputOriginalList = input(\"Input your list to be reversed: \")originalNumberList = [int(x) for x in inputOriginalList.split()]print(\"Your original list:\", originalNumberList)reversingListFunction(originalNumberList)Second Attempt Output Reverse List Number 4And as you can see, the list working perfectly now even we input it with or without spaces. Well, now that number 4 was done, we move to number 5.On this task we’ve been asked to sort the list and if the list is in-order for example [1,2,2,3] it will return true because it is in order and if it is [1,3,2,4] it’s false. And seeing that this kind of suited to use while loop in which I know, yes this is a for loop exercises section but because the condition itself is a true or false condition, that is my main reason choosing while loop.So here comes my little experiment with many attempt to solve it using while loop on this exercise.def is_sorted(sortedNumber):    x = 0    while x &gt; len(sortedNumber) - 1:        if sortedNumber[x] &lt; sortedNumber[x+1]:            return False        x = x + 1    return True        userInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [int(x) for x in userInputList.split()]print(is_sorted(numberList))    First Attempt Output Sorted Function Number 5Welp, my function do the funny and now it is returning true in a supposedly false condition…… Welp I have already applied the fibonacci thingies from my previous part 3 learning journal post with that ..... - 1: and &lt; sortedNumber[x+1]: part and looks like it’s kind working????But I could not help but to notice that, maybe this function of mine is stop comparing on the first value in the list because it literally bigger than value zero….. But to make sure, I’ll try checking it to ChatGPT if I have any missed and yep… turns out my suspicion was correct… The caused is my comparison that failing me.ChatGPT Hints To Fix Number 5 FunctionAnd with that hints, I can fix my code to be like this.def is_sorted(sortedNumber):    x = 0    while x &lt; len(sortedNumber) - 1:        if sortedNumber[x] &gt; sortedNumber[x+1]:            return False        x = x + 1    return True        userInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [int(x) for x in userInputList.split()]print(is_sorted(numberList))And here is false condition output from the code above.Second Attempt False Condition Output Sorted Function Number 5And here the true condition output.Second Attempt True Condition Output Sorted Function Number 5And just like that, a simple fix on comparison could change the output. Don’t forget to always remember to check the logic of the comparisons guys. So with task number 5 done, now we got to number 6.For this task again I need ChatGPT help to made me understand it because at the time I am doing this exercise, I was done night shift and only had 3 hours sleep lol, so my mind scatter all over place.Hints For Solving Task Number 6So in short, the task asking me to check whether the list is descending orderly. Welp, looks like the clues in the task that said it is similar to previous task is correct. So what I am gonna do now is to firstly check this first attempt code that I just changed the logic here and there.def is_sorted_dec(sortedNumberDec):    x = 0    while x &gt; len(sortedNumberDec) - 1:        if sortedNumberDec[x] &lt; sortedNumberDec[x+1]:            return False        x = x + 1    return True        userInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [int(x) for x in userInputList.split()]print(is_sorted_dec(numberList))As for the output, here is what it says.First Try Attempt Output Sorted Dec Function Number 6And when I asking ChatGPT, what is wrong with that code of mine, turns out my suspicion about the comparisons being off was true. Especially this line said ChatGPT:while x &gt; len(sortedNumberDec) - 1:I thought at first that all of comparisons that should be changed but turns out the only one that needed to are the if condition but that comparison. Why? Because the x= 0 and this made the condition always true, making the comparison returning true too early without comparing other value.So what am I gonna do next is to change that line and keep the if condition comparison and see the result.def is_sorted_dec(sortedNumberDec):    x = 0    while x &lt; len(sortedNumberDec) - 1:        if sortedNumberDec[x] &lt; sortedNumberDec[x+1]:            return False        x = x + 1    return True        userInputDecList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberDecList = [int(x) for x in userInputDecList.split()]print(is_sorted_dec(numberDecList))Here’s the moment of truth, let’s test it with both condition, starting from false condition.Second Attempt Output Dec Sorted Function False Condition Number 6Looks like it’s working, now let’s test the true condition.Second Attempt Output Dec Sorted Function True Condition Number 6Okay…. both condition are fulfilled, now we are going next to task number 7. Let’s solve it.For task number 7, I needed to confirm whether in Python able to use loop inside loop. So, here’s what I got as hints from ChatGPT.Hints From ChatGPT For Task Number 7So from that clue in my understanding we need to check all of the values in range of it and within the length of it too. After that for every value in range we add 1 to it and it need to be in length  of it. And after it looped through all of that we then compare previous loop with the second loop and after that, we return true. Sounds about right…… let`s what kinda slop code that I will made now.def has_duplicates(duplicatesNumList):    x = 0    for a in range(len(duplicatesNumList)):        for b in range(x + 1, len(duplicatesNumList)):            if duplicatesNumList[a] == duplicatesNumList[b]:                return True            else:                return False        userInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [int(x) for x in userInputList.split()]print(has_duplicates(numberList))First Attempt Duplicate Checker Task Number 7Hahahahahahaha lol, even with all of that hints from ChatGPT I still could not solve this… Oh well, skill issue on my side. So let’s ask ChatGPT what went wrong here.Hints From ChatGPT For First Attempt Task Number 7Ok… so what I am wrong on the first attempt is that the false returning it’s value too early because if it just find one pair that is not equal this value will show up. And I see that it mention the value being declared as zero…….. and this also causing it to return false too early. But then as scroll down, I see this._Really ChatGPT……. _Oh look at that, ChatGPT already answering it even though I already made it clear to not include answer and just a hint. Oh well… it is what it is I guess. Let’s follow along with the code, consider it as a bonus I guess. Here’s my code after following that.def has_duplicates(duplicatesNumList):    # x = 0    for a in range(len(duplicatesNumList)):        for b in range(a + 1, len(duplicatesNumList)):            if duplicatesNumList[a] == duplicatesNumList[b]:                return True                return False        userInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [int(a) for a in userInputList.split()]print(has_duplicates(numberList))Second Attempt Duplicate Checker Task Number 7Now it’s working properly.  And yeah, my suspicions was true, it’s the declaring variable x= 0 and using it with x + 1 was the cause. I should instead just use the previous looping variable and then add one to it and then comparing it. After that, return true but make it return false on outside of the loop. And it fixed it.Whew……. for loop exercises section done, now there’s only one left, the while loop. Let’s move on to that section.Exercises with the while statementWhile Loop Section ExerciseAnd that is all for while section exercise, just one task and that task is asking for defining even and odd number but the twist is that we need to identify it by making it clear in the output it says “Even number: 10….”. So we’ve done checking even and odd numbers previously and this time we’ve been asked to combined it with while loop. Let’s dive in and see my first attempt solving this.def evenOddFunction(x):    while x &gt;= 0:        if x % 2 == 0:            print(f\"Even number: {x}\")            x -= 1        else:           print(f\"Odd number: {x}\")           x -= 1           userInputEvenOddList = float(input(\"Input number: \"))print(evenOddFunction(userInputEvenOddList))First Attempt Even Odd Numbers Checker Number 1This first attempt really interesting to me, because the logic appear to work, but the only problem is that it’s still printing none at the end of the operation. In this code, my logic is keep subtract the number because apparently the subtraction only work inside the if else, but this turns out wrong on the explanation from the next ChatGPT hint prompt. But keep in mind this is me being exhausted but still keep forcing to learn lol.At this time, I’ve just back home from 12 hours night shift and let me tell you self doubting and what they call impostor is really strong here. It makes me really stupid and stressed because this somewhat easy task seems bigger than it seems. Maybe because the tiredness from the long shift? I don’t know, but with it, I just ask ChatGPT again to help because at this point I can’t really think straight lol.So here’s the hints given to me by ChatGPT. Despite this hints, I still failed to understand it and making a slop code again lol. But here ya go,Hints Explanation by ChatGPT For Even Odd Checker While LoopEven though all of the hints is clear from the start, I still confused and just understand the x -= 1 needed to be printed outside but how I interpreted outside here is that like this.def evenOddFunction(x):    while x &gt;= 0:        x -= 1        if x % 2 == 0:            print(f\"Even number: {x}\")        else:           print(f\"Odd number: {x}\")userInputEvenOddList = float(input(\"Input number: \"))evenOddFunction(userInputEvenOddList)Second Attempt Even Odd While Loop CheckerOkay, now I correctly moving the subtract outside but the loop keep subtracting even after reaching 0.0 making it -1.0. And that is just wack output lol. And then being me confused and scattered mind, here’s my another attempt lol.def evenOddFunction(x):    while x &gt;= 0:        if x % 2 == 0:            return f\"Even number: {x}\"        else:           return f\"Odd number: {x}\"        x -= 1userInputEvenOddList = float(input(\"Input number: \"))print(evenOddFunction(userInputEvenOddList))Third Attempt Even Odd While Loop CheckerI just keep changing back and forth here until I stuck and straight up just asking ChatGPT for the right answer and here’s what it needed to be right code exactly, seeing this and reflecting upon it, I realized I need to rest fully until my mind clear to code instead just keep forcing my limit lol.But before I’m giving up, I asked one ChatGPT one last question about what is exactly made the None shows up at the of my original code, and here’s what the ChatGPT giving its explanation.Explanation For Return and Print Usage In A FunctionOkay…. Now I kinda get it, you use return when you later wanted to use it for later by calling it with print. And as for the print, yes you could see it just like printing the return but it’s just that and the value is gone, poof! Vanished into the void just like that. And at this time around it clicked on my hazy mind(despite being already explain on the previous hints lol).So with that, I got it clicked in my head and start changing my previous code. Because the answer just directly in front of my face. Here’s it is, my code first attempt but with understanding of print vs return.def evenOddFunction(x):    while x &gt;= 0:        if x % 2 == 0:            print(f\"Even number: {x}\")            x -= 1        else:           print(f\"Odd number: {x}\")           x -= 1           userInputEvenOddList = float(input(\"Input number: \"))evenOddFunction(userInputEvenOddList)Output After Understand How return and print WorksAnd would you look at that, I got it correct now, despite being given such clear answer previously lol. But, ChatGPT has better suggestion than mine, it’s basically just like my second attempt, to move the subtraction outside of the if else condition like this.def evenOddFunction(x):    while x &gt;= 0:        if x % 2 == 0:            print(f\"Even number: {x}\")        else:           print(f\"Odd number: {x}\")        x -= 1           userInputEvenOddList = float(input(\"Input number: \"))evenOddFunction(userInputEvenOddList)And the output still the same but in more efficient way to executing the logic. But, I asked ChatGPT that supposed I want to use return for that kind of task, because when I first tried the third attempts, I got the subtraction is not considered(simply just being grayed out). So, here is what ChatGPT suggesting the usage of return in this kind of task.def evenOddFunction(x):    result = []  # an empty list to store results    while x &gt;= 0:        if x % 2 == 0:            result.append(f\"Even number: {x}\")        else:            result.append(f\"Odd number: {x}\")        x -= 1    return result  # now return the entire listuserInput = int(input(\"Input number: \"))messages = evenOddFunction(userInput)for message in messages:    print(message)And I can see that you wanted to collect all of the values first in an empty list, after that doing the comparison, then appending it(save it) into that empty list and then saving it using return result(unlike my third attempt where return that being declared follow by the operation, making the operation grayed out/not considered because return is where function is stop its process and saving the value gained by that process). So in that ChatGPT code, after the value saved in return, we now could input the value, then using for loop to helps us printing each result automatically using loop.And that is all of the learning material and exercises in this section, really such a long learning but with this I gained somewhat fundamental understanding of core subject and that being return, function, print, loop logic, and function basic understanding.Thank you wordsThank you again for Professor João Ventura for this wonderful learning resource, I will keep my learning journey in Python using this book because of the simple and direct way of learning and teaching.

    "content": "Chapter 5: Modules and FunctionsThis chapter of my Python learning journey is really interesting for me, because I always fascinated as to how computers being able to process complex mathematic problem and with Python it is possible when we import math modules that containing mathematical function, that way we could perform something like this:import mathprint(math.cos(0.0)) print(math.radians(275))Example of Mathematical Operations Using Math ModuleAfter I trying out the math module, next I tried defining function as per instructed by the book, to see just got the feels of how to make one of it.def printTexts():    print(\"This is\")    print(\"a text\")printTexts()Trying Out Defining Function First TimeAnd after I tried writing function in Python, I arrived at this section in the book.Return Instruction Inside Python FunctionThis thing called return is really bothering me since the first time I learned programming in highschool, so I tried asking ChatGPT to make an example out of it. An example that maybe even a child could understand, so here’s how it is being explained.Example of Return ExplanationFrom that example, I could make understanding that return is how we telling computer to returning the result/output back to us instead just lost into the void. So when I tried defining function with mathematical processing inside it but without return here’s how the output.Example of Function Without ReturnAnd yep, without return the code just made the operations but the result vanished, resulting in code printing None as the result because it hold none of the result from the value that being process.Welp looks like I got the hang out of it or something like that, so with that in mind, let’s just start straight to the exercises, for this chapter there’s three parts of exercise and each with their own objective that will teaches us different ways to use math module and also combining it with function that we just learn. Here’s the first part of it below.Exercises with the math modulePart One Exercises of Math Module ChapterFrom the first part, we will begin by solving first exercise, to find the greatest common divisor of the designated numbers. At first, I don’t understand what is greatest common divisor and when I search on the internet what does it mean I got this result.Greatest Common Divisor/GCDOkay, so Python have their own template module for this kind of numerical operation, welp let’s try this to the first task. We being task finding bunch of pairs, here’s my codeCode of GCDI tried first approach by directly printing it along with it’s mathematical operation but then an idea struck my head, “how about if i directly defining function for it showing multiple gcd operations?” and that is the story behind that function. Also ChatGPT giving me some advice as to making it more effective and cleaner, and with that suggestion I now know something new again about function and that is it could be made to accept value using parameter like this.Making GCD More Cleaner &amp; EffectiveWith that now, I now get the rough idea how to make function now. Function can be made without using parameter or with one and we could also make it accepting value/values with that parameter. Let’s move on to second task and here’s my first attempt to solve it.First Attempt Log2 CodeI tried my first attempt by straight made the module processing a whole list of value but turns out in Python can’t do that and yep, it asked me to assigning it to real number and not a list. And when I see ChatGPT explanation about log2 operation I got this result.ChatGPT Log2 LogicSo, with that kind of logic I came up with this as second attempt.Second Attempt Log2 CodeI just error because I tried to log2 value 0 and when I search and asked ChatGPT, I just know that value 0 returns error because it’s like telling the code how many times do the given number be divided with 2 until it reach the given number(yep, I really bad when explaining math, oh well I’m stupid when it comes to math as well). To make illustration, here’s how in practice would look like:log₂(8) = 3 → Because 2 × 2 × 2 = 8log₂(1) = 0 → Because 2⁰ = 1And now imagine what number can be raise 2 that will give us 0? Well, none right? That is why the machine is getting error. So to fix that, I just go with this code.Third Attempt Log2 CodeYep, just simply making the log2 of 0 is a printable string and the rest is the real math operation. And as you can see, I use function too for processing multiple log2 operation but the best way to make this possible other than making the code processing the log2 each time manually, we could use loop but because for now I just follow the books canonically now, making the loop out of question for now but rest assured, loop will appear for the next chapter. For now, let’s just use only function. With that, second task is complete, now we go to third task.The third task is quite tricky, because it involve with user input and to that, I first making a rough sketch of the code so that I could feel working my way through the correct code. Here’s how making the logic with the sketch code that I made.print(\"Please input your numbers: \"{user_input = input()})def calculus_function(x):    cos(user_input)    sin(user_input)    tan(x)print calculus_function()As you can see I got it wrong on a several places and it’s all over my code. The fix will explain in the next attempt that I do to make this code worked, but for now let’s see why I failed and it can be listed as such:  String Formatting MistakeThe mistake is on the code line print(\"Please input your numbers: \"{user_input = input()}). I still not quite familiar with how python worked at this time, so I just go with how I know taking an input from my badly memory from my Kotlin programming day. And yep, turns out I’m wrong.  Using sin(), cos(), and tan() Without Importing    cos(user_input)sin(user_input)tan(x)        Those lines are so wrong because looking back at it, what the hell am I thinking, calling cos, sin, tan without import the math module? Yep, always remember to check all of the imported module before calling their function guys.    Using a Parameter (x) vs Input Variable    def calculus_function(x):cos(user_input)sin(user_input)tan(x)        This is one was also me tripping, why do I called user_input when I declare the parameter as x.    Calling the Functionprint calculus_function() line really shows how deep my Kotlin habit implanted and when I tried asking ChatGPT, it says that I’m using Python 2 style when in fact I should be using print(calculus_function(....)).With that, I tried another attempt with this code.user_input = input(\"Please input your number: \")user_number = float(user_input)def calculus_function(x):   math.cos(x)   math.sin(x)   math.tan(x)print(calculus_function(user_number))→ NoneThe output of those code is just None and with that attempt I discover another things to know about Python, when the function reaches the end of it, if you don’t declaring it to returning anything, it will simply return nothing. That is why the result is just none. Another things I discover and let’s move to another failed attempt from me lol.Function Not Processing Inputted ValueYou see here that my attempt this time is not processing the value being inputted just straight up printing it. When I asked ChatGPT, it says that I literally just told my code to “Take value of x and do some math thingy(sin, cos, tan) but don’t store it or return it’s value.” ChatGPT giving me hint that I need to store the results of the process and then return it on my function, and with that clue, here’s another slop code from me.Function Working Properly But Still Return NoneYet another slop code from me, this time I do some wacky stuff. Letting the function worked properly but then revert to returning none wkwkwkwkwk. This wacky stuff happen because I still doesn’t instructing my function to returning anything but the print itself just printing anything that being instructed to it. It doesn’t store anything into function, even though I’ve already declaring it inside a variable. So here’s yet another attempt of mine.import mathuser_input = input(\"Please input your number: \")user_number = float(user_input)def calculus_function(x):   cos_process = math.cos(x)   sin_process = math.sin(x)   tan_process = math.tan(x)   final_result = cos_process, sin_process, tan_process   return final_resultprint(calculus_function(user_number))→Please input your number: 90(-0.4480736161291701, 0.8939966636005579, -1.995200412208242)As you can see, I just delete the print() from the variable and now the function working properly, because now the value being saved to the variable properly. But I’m not done yet, I think just showing numbers that look like a maniac rambling wouldn’t make sense to the reader, so I asked ChatGPT how could I make the output more recognizable, because at this point I don’t know how to combining variable with strings output(kinda like labeling it). And ChatGPT answered me with this suggestion:final_result = f\"cos: {cos_process}, sin: {sin_process}, tan: {tan_process}\"return final_resultAnd for me that is a new discovery, because I before that point still don’t know how to do that kind of thing. So when I discovered it by ChatGPT, that is adding new knowledge to my head, thx ChatGPT. But oh yeah, there’s also another suggestion such as:final_result = {    \"cos\": cos_process,    \"sin\": sin_process,    \"tan\": tan_process}return final_resultinside the function and we still get the same result but what’s nice about this suggestion is that we could accessing the each variable individually like this:result = calculus_function(user_number)print(result[\"tan\"])Accessing Variable IndividuallyWe use string as the pointer to pointing at the specific variable for then we could see the result of it. Quite fancy eh, really thank you so much ChatGPT for the nice insight. With that, we done with first exercise section, now we proceed continue to the second section exercise.Exercises with functionsFunction Exercise SectionHere comes another exercises, this time it is more challenging for me. Welp let’s see how my attempt goes and by that I mean let’s see another slop that I made.Completing Task On First Try, Cihuy!🎉Looks like for this task I completing it in just one try and quite amusing when I got it clicked in the first try oh and for convenience, let’s just straight complete add3 function too, at this time in my understanding you just simply put another one input instruction. Here’s the code:add2_input_a = float(input(\"Input your first number: \"))add2_input_b = float(input(\"Input your second number: \"))add2_input_c = float(input(\"Input your third number: \"))def add2_function(a, b, c):    sums_function = f\"The sum up of your two number is: {a + b + c}\"    return sums_functionprint(add2_function(add2_input_a, add2_input_b, add2_input_c))→Input your first number: 1   Input your second number: 2Input your third number: 3The sum up of your two number is: 6.0But! I’m not done yet, I got curious about what other way I could do this more efficient or maybe there’s some improvement can be done here, so I asked ChatGPT again for that, and here’s some suggestion that it made:ChatGPT SuggestionThis suggestion really intrigues me, because it such a simple way of saying “grab whatever the fuck you want”. But how’s that possible? Well that is possible because of the wildcard(*) operator. It basically telling the computer to input whatever being inputted, be it an integer or strings. Soo I got an idea, how about I try using that and also some template function to simplify my code previously. Well here how it goes:add2_input_a = float(input(\"Input your first number: \"))add2_input_b = float(input(\"Input your second number: \"))add2_input_c = float(input(\"Input your third number: \"))def add2_function(*args):    return f\"The sum is: {sum(args)}\"print(add2_function(add2_input_a, add2_input_b, add2_input_c))→Input your first number: 1   Input your second number: 2Input your third number: 3The sum up of your two number is: 6.0Notice the difference on the function logic, I just change the parameters first so that the input can be as many as you wanted, I also changed the a + b + c to simply just using sum(....). Just with a simple tweak like that could make the code goes a long way, I am getting more excited to learn next task, well… here’s my attempt on the next task below.Second task is comparison between two value that being input. At first I don’t really understand what it really wants. So I asked ChatGPT for clearance.ChatGPT Helping For ClearanceSo with that help from ChatGPT, I start make the code for my first attempt.Comparison Function First AttemptTo my surprise, this first attempt working perfectly but ChatGPT made suggestion about the way that I call previous variable(the input). That is not wrong, but for more cleaner and reusable I could change the code to:comparingInput_a = float(input(\"Input your number to be compared: \"))comparingInput_b = float(input(\"Input your number to be compared: \"))def comparing_number_function(a, b):    if a &gt; b:        return f\"The number {comparingInput_a} is greater than {comparingInput_b}\"    else:        return f\"The number {comparingInput_b} is greater than {comparingInput_a}\"print(comparing_number_function(comparingInput_a, comparingInput_b))That way my code is much more cleaner and the output still the same. Well looks like that’s it for number one, unto number two.Divisible FunctionAnd yep, the function this time working properly as intended and returning the correct output. But when I asked ChatGPT about it, there’s suggestion that making the code more cleaner. Here’s the suggestion:def is_divisible(a, b):    result = a % b == 0    print(f\"The number {a} is{' ' if result else ' not '}divisible by {b}\")    return result# Testa = int(input(\"Enter number a: \"))b = int(input(\"Enter number b: \"))print(\"Result:\", is_divisible(a, b))To my surprise, in Python you could do something like this and it really nice things to know. It made the code much more readable and simple. The conditional can be used in one line and with it you could just use return value one time, making it more efficient.Last task for me is quite ambiguous for what it meant. Is it wanted me to pass a fixed input or me being able to input whatever value list into the code? So I asked ChatGPT for clearance for what it meant by that.ChatGPT List Average SuggestionFucking ChatGPT, I have not yet told it to solve it…….As you can see from those two pictures, I have confirmation that it is indeed possible to pass input and made it into a list. But when I scroll down my ChatGPT, to my surprise it already answered my question, fucking AI. I’m not instructing it to solve it, but oh well here we are getting spoiled. But I still attempt to solve it my own way, and if ChatGPT suggesting using function average() I will do it manually.def is_divisible(a, b):    if a % b == 0:        return f\"The number {a} is divisible with number {b}\"    else:        return f\"The number {a} is not divisible with number {b}\"    userInputList = input(\"Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: \")numberList = [float(x) for x in userInputList.split()]averageList = sum(numberList) / len(numberList)print(averageList)→Input multiple numbers separated by spaces: 2 3 4 53.5Well that’s it from me, it’s still the same function as ChatGPT answered but what I learned from here is that, comprehensions list can be combined with input to make a list. Oh and also ChatGPT suggesting me to made the print like this.print(f\"The average of the numbers you entered is: {averageList}\")Yep, that’s it for exercise with functions in Python, there’s so much new things that I learned from this exercise alone. But there’s still one exercise section left for us to learn from this chapter of the book. So let’s get into it.Exercises with recursive functionsThe last section of exercise of this chapter and we will go a bit of mathematical logic for this function(well it’s in the name duh…). Here’s the task for this section.Recursive Functions Exercises SectionAs you can see it is only just three task but for the first task it’s quite easy, just a plain factorial operation and would you look at that, it’s already answered by the book above, take a look.Already Answered lolAs you can see it’s already answered and I just shamelessly copy paste it and here’s what it look like in the code.Just Shamelessly Copy Pasting ItWell not much that I have to say about this other than when I checked it on the calculator the result is correct. Well that is that for first task, now for the real challenge, task number 2. Because I’m slow and kinda dumb when it comes to math, I try asking ChatGPT about the clue for the second task, and looks like I got the key clue about it, here’s the clue.Suggestion From ChatGPT For Recursive FunctionSo, with that on mind, I try my first attempt with this code below.First Attempt of Sums Up Recursive FunctionThat is my first attempt to solve the second task, so I tried checking whether it’s true that it is the result or not, and to my surprise ChatGPT answering that it is the right call to change * to + and I still defining x - 1 so it could call function recursively. But there’s some minor minor mistakes, such as:  I still naming the function factorial but it should be changed to a suited name because it might confused my future self or other people that read my code, so ChatGPT suggesting to change it to something like sum_up_to.  I still returning value 1 where instead I should return 0. So the code should be like this:def factorial(x):    if x == 0:        return 1    else:        return x + factorial(x-1)    print(factorial(10))→55The output is different now, it’s 55 now instead of 56. Why? Because when the return value is 1 it just + 1 at the end of summing up. But when it’s return 0, it will be just ` + 0` at the end of it. That is why it’s 55 now. And now it’s done for the second task, now we move to the last one, so here’s my attempt to do it.First Attempt FibonacciNow that my stupid ass attempting to solve it failed and it turns into error loop I once again asking ChatGPT for clues and what surprises me that this one right here, below.In Front of My Eyes…. lolThe clues already mentioned and just right in front of me but I thought that “no way this is the answer” and yep, my skill issue brain got slapped by ChatGPT again.Fibonacci Hints from ChatGPTAnd yep the clue already in front of me but yeah, I’m just that dumb to realize it, so yeah, here’s my code using all of those clues.Fibonacci Function Final AnswerAnd yep, the function work properly and returning the correct answer. But what is Fibonacci exactly? Fibonacci in simple term is numbers in a set that being summed by the previous values on that set, so something like this:n\tfib(n)0\t01\t12\t1 (1 + 0)3\t2 (1 + 1)4\t3 (2 + 1)5\t5 (3 + 2)6\t8 (5 + 3)7\t13 (8 + 5)...\t...So as you can see from the logic we will be returning 0 if the first value on the set is 0, or else if it’s value 1 we will returning one but other than those number we will be doing minus 1 to match previous number(which is 1) and for that point on ward we will use minus 2 to match previous number(being 2) and so on forth.And yeah all of the exercises for this chapter is now done and thank you again for follow along my learning journal for this chapter. I’ll do next journal for loop and iterations chapter and once again, thank you so much for your time reading this."

    "content": "Chapter 4: ListsNext chapter after Datatypes, in this chapter it’s more focused on how to comprehend how’s the lists work in Python, how to use them, and how to process it. Without further ado, here’s the stuff that I learned throughout this chapter:First List ExercisesChapter 4: ListsIn this chapter, there’s only one basic exercise but with a multiple task that follows it, so I’ll go through each one of the task being given. So here’s my first attempt solving first task.Slicing ListsIn that code, I just concatenate the two sliced part of the lists whilst I also could do this instead:l = [1, 4, 9, 10, 23]print(l[1:3])print(l[3:5])But I feel like it would be more neat to just meshed them together. The next task is appending the list and here’s how my learning goes like.Appending ListsLet me explain the learning process that I just go through here. So my first initial thought would be, “How about if I just use append function but use AND operator, I mean it would be joined the two value right?”. And to my surprise it’s not that simple Ferguso lol. The result shows that I just appending value 0, so I got curious and search on the internet explanation from GeeksforGeeks about it and it says that AND/&amp; operator is processing value integer that being given is in bitwise operation. Here’s what it would look like.1 &amp; 2  → bitwise AND  → 0001 &amp; 0010 = 0000 → 0And for a little bit context, AND will only result 1 if both value, in this case binary is both 1. So yeah, what I thought would be easy task turns out there’s a lot to it. But how can we appending multiple value then to the list? And that would be concatenate operator at the of the code. The concatenate at the end shows us that we could adding multiple values to the lists and not replacing the previous values inside it but you could also use it to just adding one value but it’s such a waste to not use it for more than one values right?.There’s also one function that does that and that is .extend([]). You could just use it like this:l = [1, 2]l.extend([3, 4, 5])print(l)  # → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]And with that, the values being added just like the way concatenation does it. The next task is calculating the average of all the values inside the list. So here’s my learning goes on.Summing &amp; Average ListsWell would you look at that, the average output of the summing is 122 with average 17.4285... and I feel like it’s not the right amount, so when I calculate it with all of the number listed there the result sum has to be 292 average of 32,4444. But why is the result like that?Turns out if we just concatenate the list, we only just joins the value into the lists but in a non-destructive way. What it means is that, we didn’t change anything not until we save it with some variable. And notice that only append() function that change the list right? Welp let’s see how is it if we save the concatenation inside variable, in this case let’s save it again in l list variable again.Summing &amp; Average Lists After FixAnd with that, we fixed the code. This is really new to me too, because usually I thought it would be automatically saved but welp, the more I know. Okay, unto the next task again, removing values out of list.Removing Lists ValuesYes, I know the task told me to just remove [4, 9] but I wanted to experiment a little bit. So here’s interesting to that happened when I done my little experiment. First I tried removing value by using .remove() function, it worked. Try using del module combine with defining the range of the index(remember, it start from 0 and end in one index more of the last index) is also working. But when I tried to use - thinking that it would work because + is working when adding values. But to my surprise it’s not simple like that.So yeah you could just use .remove() when removing one values or del module combined with index to remove multiple values.Here’s my fixing of the code previously and let’s see the result.Removing Lists Values After FixAnd the code working fine and dandy now, the values are also being removed as you can see from the output. So yeah, there’s two ways to removing specific values out of from the list, I could be not knowing if there’s another ways to do it but let me know if there is another way.Second Comprehensions ListLet’s go to the next task, list comprehensions. Here’s the task in the book.List Comprehensions ExercisesWith that, let’s jump straight to the exercise, start with number 1. Number 1 asking to make list of squares of the first 10 numbers. This below is my first attempt to solve the exercise, keep in mind, this attempt I made without reading the book or any ChatGPT hint at first, so this pure my understanding of the assignment.List of Fist 10 Numbers Square First AttemptWhen I tried asking ChatGPT for hint to solve it, it gave this hints to fix it.Hints From ChatGPTAnd I agree with him, why do I need to square it with the variable itself but the one to my surprise is that I don’t need if condition, and that I should consider x ** 2 instead x ** x. And when I look back in the book again, I got my clue on this explanation.Hint From The BookAnd then, it clicked on my mind as what the code would look like. So here’s how I complete number 1.List of First 10 Squares Numbers Second AttemptAnd turns out, it’s correct. You don’t even need condition for it. Nice to know that you could be so simple when it comes to making list in Python. This is also new stuff for me as well. So let’s move on to number two of the exercise.List of First 20 Cubes Numbers Second AttemptExercise number 2 is done by just one attempt because I’ve somewhat got grasps of the logic and not much to be explained here other than the number of the multiplier set to 3. Next, exercise number 3, that is even and odd numbers from the range of 0 - 20. Here’s my learning goes for exercise number 3.Even &amp; Odd List Numbers First AttemptThis is done on second attempt, on this first attempt of me make the list, we see that it uses for expression to make it looping so that it could continues until the specific range that we set, in this case I set to 20 but turns out this where my little mistake being pointed out by ChatGPT. Here’s what it says.Even &amp; Odd List Suggestion by ChatGPTAnd with that, I fixed the code and turns out, the output is also different from my first attempt code.Even &amp; Odd List Numbers Second AttemptNotice on the list of even numbers it’s now included number 20? Yep, little mistake right there really make much difference. So I gotta be careful but you’ll see me fumbling sometimes on that kind of little mistake throughout this whole journal lol. Now, when to my surprised, ChatGPT giving me a challenge at the end of the prompt. I thought the challenge is interesting and so I try to solve it, the challenge goes like this.Even &amp; Odd List ChallengeWell that challenge is really interesting so for me it turned a simple true or false output into a readable format. So here’s what attempt looks like when I solve that challenge.Even &amp; Odd List Challenge First AttemptAnd to that attempt ChatGPT says, it’s indeed correct but it could be more effective and it basically suggesting to me that I could mesh together the if condition with the list, so it clicked on my mind and here’s how I fix it.Even &amp; Odd List Challenge Second AttemptAnd this is also a new thing for me, it’s so simple, readable and just look cool to me. This what’s makes me excited to keep learning Python basically hahahaha. So we could see that the statement can be just initialized first instead and the rest condition will follow soon and lastly we set the range with for loop.For the next task, we’ve been asked to make code that shows us the sums of the first 20 numbers from 0 - 20 to be exact. But the twist here is that, it needed to be even numbers and the result should be 1140. The task also need us to check the list by printing it and then sums all of the numbers. So here’s my attempt to solve that task.Summing Even Numbers ListAnd yep, that exercise previously really makes me clicked the logic of comprehensions list and I just solved it on the first try. As the task said too, the result really is 1140 but it should be done by now right? Welp it is but when I asked ChatGPT it gives me another useful insight to use comprehensions list in Python and it really make the code more concise, here’s how it goes.Even &amp; Odd List Challenge Short VersionAnd would you look at that, I never thought that the list could just be summed up directly like that lol wkwkwkwkwkwk, and yes I know the range this time is 21 but that is just me want to try expanding the range and see what will happen to the output and looks like the output has been increased 400 because square 20 is included. So yep, that is my learning on this number 4 exercise.It’s time for the last exercise, this is how I attempting to solve the exercise.First Attempt of Last ExerciseIn that first attempt I tried with adding and x / 2 on the logic there and although the result is correct but I feel like the logic just seems off to me and that is why I checked it in ChatGPT to see it myself what is the wrong there. And my guess was right, here’s what ChatGPT suggesting me to fix on my logic.Even &amp; Odd List Fix SuggestionAnd turns out my guess was right, the x / 2 is the one that seems off and with this one suggestion from ChatGPT, I agree with it, the logic is just that it needed to be NOT divisible by 3, that is the key here, the NOT operator. With that being sad, now that I got it clicked on how to fix it, here’s my fix of it.Second Attempt of Last ExerciseThe result still the same but the logic and the condition also being more solid here on this fix. And with that, the last exercise task being done, I’m fully done with list learning chapter for now. Next is function and modules chapter, see you on the next journal learning."

    "content": "Appreciation WordsThis learning was possible because I got informed by this GitHub repo and in it there’s so many learning resources about cyber security, ethical hacking, network, programming and many more. And I stumbled upon e-book titled “Full Speed Python” by João Ventura, where his book teaches python but with such a simple way and hands-on practice too. What I also like about his book is that, it presented in such a simple way and really straight to the point. I really recommending reading his book.Once again thank you so much for Sir João Ventura for this book and the learning material, you’re awesome.Welcome!This is my first attempt to write a learning journal about what I just learn when learning Python programming, new things that I just knows about python, debugging that I just learn, and many more. This one will be just short writing, so if you look for tutorial, I suggest to go to GeeksforGeeks python tutorial, W3Schools, or better yet google the heck out of it.So let’s get started with what I just learn and maybe you could learn one or two things from my learning progress too.Some Stuff That I LearnedWe just gonna go straight to the chapter 3 of the book. Because chapter 2 is just explaining how to installing python on various OS and because I already installing python on my device I just skipping it. Otherwise, if you guys still don’t have python installed, follow along from chapter 2.Chapter 3: DatatypesChapter 3: DatatypesIn this chapter we mainly focusing on declaring variable, learning basic of datatypes i.e. numbers and strings. So the things that I discovered when doing the exercises on this chapter is as follows:      The basic of python variable is just the same with other programming language and it feels so simple too. Previously I was using Kotlin and I feels like python is more straight forward than it.Variables in Python        This one really unique for me lol, I just knows in python you could multiply strings and the result would be the string multiplied. The more I know…Multiplying String        This one is also interesting to me and I will always keep in mind. But before I explain, take a look of this picture.Python Way of Reading CodeThe picture above shows that I have multiple line of codes from the previous attempt that I made, and when I try outputting the script, the process would be like this.Python Way of Reading CodePython processing the mathematical operation on the upper part of codes and after that it shows the output which is 7 and then unto next process which is multiplying the string. And lastly it would stop at input process like picture above and for the next process would explained on the next point.        Next, let’s take a look of the string list below.Python Processing String &amp; ConcatenationFrom that picture I just know that despite being on the list, the strings in it can be also be combined with the numerical operation such as multiply and plus. But at the same time, I know it could also be combined with the string that I inputted. Let’s try I input Albert and let’s see what the output would be like.Output of String ListAnd look at that, the input being shown alongside the multiplied string from the list, in this case it’s the string on the number 2 position. A little side note for me and maybe you, computer start counting from 0, so if you want to call something from the beginning, you have to put 0 not 1 because computer reads it as the second. And in that code of mine, I just called number 2, which is on the third position(john) based on computer logic.The code also showing the string being multiplied three times and lastly being combined with the input by calling it’s variable.    We move to number two exercise with number. Take a look of the task given below.Number 2 Exercise With NumbersOn that, we being asked to do average of the sequences of some numbers. So I got curious and I thought “I want try to use loop to perform that operation”, let me show you how my curiosity when on shown below:Wrong Loop For AveragingOutput of Wrong Loop For AveragingAs you can see from my stupidly written code, the line number /= manual_sum doesn’t affecting anything and just vanished into the void doing nothing. And so I asked ChatGPT about it and it giving me a hint to use len(sequence_x) so that I could fraction the sum by the numbers of the elements inside it. And so I follow along the suggestion and fixing it like this below.Another Failed ScriptAnother Failed OutputWelp, just me being silly again, this time when I asked ChatGPT again as why my code outputting like that, it suggest that I still dividing the manual_sum within each loop. It would go like:First loop number = 2manual_sum += 2 → manual_sum = 2manual_sum /= 2 → manual_sum = 1.0Second loop number = 4manual_sum += 4 → manual_sum = 5.0manual_sum /= 2 → manual_sum = 2.5So from that point on ChatGPT Suggesting that I need to first summing all of the numbers and only after that I can divide the full total of it. At first I was confused by this, but I remember maybe ChatGPT meant that it need to be place outside of the loop. And so here’s my attempt at processing the average after the loop.Correct ScriptCorrect OutputAnd tadaa~~ that what ChatGPT meant by processed outside the loop. So in Python, be mindful of the positioning because it really is that important. Python really sensitive with that kind of stuff. ChatGPT also criticize me of why using loop for that operation, saying that it’s an overkill to use it, I could just go use something like.    sequence_1 = (2, 4)average = sum(sequence_1) / len(sequence_1)print(average)        And yeah, it’s correct that I’m overkill but I just curious and I also got to learn loop along the way too. Unto next learning that do.        Unto the next sequence and that is (12, 14/6, 15), and after learned how to use loop, I thought to use it again.Calling Wrong VariableBut, would you look at that, I got wrong output again all because one simple mistake.Output for Calling Wrong VariableAll of that because I wrongly calling variable number in the second sequence loop and remember that I still got previous script on the same file, so it calling wrong variable making it false. So from this I learned that I need to be careful about what variable being called on the progress and don’t forget naming your variable with some meaningful and describing name to prevent this thing happening. So, just change variable number to integer and the result would be.Output for Calling Right VariableAnd the correct output is 9.777777777777779. Unto my next learning.    Next is task number 3, now we’re being tasked to find the volume of a sphere shown below.Task Number 3, Finding Sphere VolumeI kinda lost in thought about how to solve this question but I try my best and start with what I called rough sketch of what the script would look like and it goes like this:    pi = 3.1415radius = 5## 4/3 *= pi## pi ** 3## print (pi)        I said to ChatGPT that I also wanted to loop for that task too but it kinda against my idea. So I asked why is that and it says that there’s more cleaner way to do it like just straight up:    pi = 3.1415radius = 5volume = (4/3) * pi * (radius ** 3)print(volume)        Because that is more clear to read, fast to execute, and minimalist but also expressive. Which is look like my rough sketch but me being still curious, my ChatGPT giving me an ideal scenario for me to use loop for this kind of operation, so it goes like this.Searching Sphere Volume With ListChatGPT suggesting me to change the task to using list, instead of just one integer value, and so, I accepted it and get to working on it, and it would look like this.Output Loop For Searching Volume of Radius ListBut, what is this? The output is just showing the last value from the list. And with that I remember that position is really matters again. So the correct code would be this.  pi = 3.1415radius = [1, 3, 5, 7]for radii in radius:    volume = (4/3) * pi * (radii ** 3)    print(f\"Radius: {radii}, Volume: {volume}\")Correct Output Loop For Searching Volume of Radius ListSo, I asked ChatGPT again, what is the logic for the positioning in Python, why is it so sensitive about it. ChatGPT response was Python work by reading code line by line(left to right), top to bottom, but because previously my print(volume) code is outside the loop, that is the same way of telling Python to print the output once and that happen after the loop. That is why it just processing and hold the last calculation within the list.      Next exercise is using modulo operator % and to check whether the number is even or odd.Odd or Even TaskAnd my first attempt to solve that task is like this.First Attempt Even or Odd CodeOutput of First Attempt Even or Odd Code  Why the error again? Yep, me being stoopid and not positioning the print part INSIDE the if condition. So let’s try again. And you see that odd looking odds %= odd? Yeah, that is me being a dumbo again, doing some gibberish and ended up using uninitialized variable and ChatGPT suggesting don’t use %= operator, unless you wanted to use the value repeatedly. So, let’s see more of my another attempt again and let’s just skimmed through it, because it just me guessing the correct way.Second Attempt Even or Odd Code Third Attempt Even or Odd CodeFourth Attempt Even or Odd CodeAnd that is how I find the correct code to find even and odd number inside the sequence. I admit, I play around a bit and there’s also me being a dumbo but hope you guys learn something too from this. To the next task.        Our next task is a True/False condition, here’s the exercise.True/False Condition ExerciseFor this exercise, it is quite straight forward, we have been assigned to find True or False of that condition.Output True/False ConditionThat is how I do the task, for me it is quite self explaining, the script is processing AND, a logic gate operation of computer. There’s various logic gate on computer that you could here. In short, the code being run here is a AND logic gate, where the value needed to be matched each other for the condition to be TRUE.        We move to another subject of datatypes and that is strings, here’s the task given for us to play around with it.Strings Datatype ExercisesI’ll begin with number 1, as you can see the instruction says to initialize strings with name s and calculate it’s length, also to print its value multiple times. So, here’s my answer to the task.First, find the length, it’s pretty simple and straight forward.Counting String Length Using len FunctionAs you can see, I just use len() function to let the do it for me. And you can also see that I use str() function surrounding it and that is to convert the len() function into string so that I could concatenate it with other string. And for the result variable, I left it there for the this next task. Let’s get into it.Multiplying String OutputAnd I change result variable to multiplying and concatenating the string index. I take ChatGPT suggestion into consideration this time for not using loop because it would be an overkill and the result still the same.        To the second task and with different string value of aaabbbccc, the task is to find first occurrence of string b and ccc. The second task is to replacing a to X. Let’s get into the learning of it.First Attempt Finding and Replacing StringThis is my first attempt to answer the task, from the picture you could see that I use function find() and replace(). At first I didn’t know such function exist and when I search on internet and find that W3Schools suggest me this and also ChatGPT told me that it also has for finding value. I just try using it and here I’m. Now, when I back to ChatGPT for checking is my code already correct based on the given task. It says that I would not need to concatenate the result of both replace. Because it would overlap with the other list result of it. So, here’s my fix to it.Second Attempt Finding and Replacing StringAnd that is my fix, from the output we know that replace function is making new version of output version with each their usage.        Last question, with aaa bbb ccc as the value of the variable. We’ve been asked replace the given value of it and here’s some discovery and learning that I got.Replacing StringThe discovery that I know by doing this is that in Python you could use multiple function at once and as you can see from the picture, I used three function at once and it’s just work fine. But there’s also discovery that I made that made us possible using replace function.Other Method Using Replace FunctionWith this method, we initializing the first process, save it to other process and reusing it when needed. The nature of Python that saves the value of the variable made this possible. And as far as my current shallow knowledge of Python, this made the code more readable.  Thank You WordsThank you all for your time reading this little learning journal that I made. My planning is to made this frequently as I progressively learn Python until I finish all of the material in the book.

    "content": "Before We StartWelcome to another post of me yapping about cyber security. This time, I want to yap about how to build your own dashboard in Elastic. This post is done with objective of allowing us to understand how to build dashboard that suit your need or my need while also learning the progress of making it along the way. Bild 👍With that being said, the type of dashboard that we will be building is login/logon dashboard that designed to track and count how many attempt of login that happened to our machines that have Elastic agent installed inside it. This will helps us better understand what or who could make this attempt possible, the intention of this attempt, source of this attempt and many more important information that could help us understanding and recognizing threats.This post is inspired by Tech with Jono video of titled IMPROVE Your Cybersecurity Portfolio like this… and in that video there’s mentioning about making dashboard as portfolio and I thought, “yeah, that is also important and it rhymes with my brute force post.” and here we’re creating the post about it.What Is Dashboard?A little bit of background explanation to understand what is ‘dashboard’. From Elastic official documentation we know that dashboard is best way to visualize and sharing insight from your Elasticsearch data. So with that visualization we could make charts, tables, metrics, and also maps in order to help enhancing the visual and helping us to understand better.Default Page For Dashboard MenuPicture above showing us what dashboard main page looks like and as you can see there’s many existing templates that you could choose for the visualization. But for now we don’t really need this but in the near future you’re being asked to make a custom dashboard that not available from the templates.And for that what would do? Well, we make our own dashboard and that is what this post about. I know from the picture above, I already made one of login/logon dashboard but I will make another one that will track failed logon attempt. Without much further yapping, let’s get into it.Creating New DashboardOn the main Dashboard page click on Create dashboard button and this will direct us to Editing page where here we could use what type data that we want to visualize, what query it will be using(yes, they use query too for retrieving data or information that we want), and many more options that could help us with dashboard making process.New Dashboard Creation PageAbove as you can see, it’s what I called customization page where we could choose what type of visualization that we want. Because I’m also still learning and didn’t know much about dashboard feature and it’s full capabilities, I’ll just utilize the existing template available from Elastic library by clicking Add from library button and it will show Add from library page on the right side, like shown below.Template Lists of VisualizationFrom that library menu on the right we now then could search for visualization that we wanted, for me I just search using key word logon on the search bar and it will shows all templates that related to it. For this dashboard, because we want it to track failed logon attempt, choose failed logon tsvb, logon failed table, failed logon heatmap, logon failed account, logon failed source ip as the visualization and after you choosing it, close the page and let’s see what the templates looks like.Failed Logon AttemptAs you can see, the template’s working and showing data of failed logon attempt, also notice that I use Last 7 days as time range for it. This is because I want to catch as many as possible of failed logon attempts, and looks like I got so many hits with it. That’s perfect but for me there’s still one missing thing and that is charts to help us understanding the statistics more better.Because I cannot find any charts or graphics that suit my need, I’ll just create one myself. To do that, just click on Create visualization button on the left side of your page and you will be shown Edit visualization page like this.Creating New Visualization Chart And Customizing Horizontal AxisThere’s a lot in here but what we want to focus first is on the middle part of the page, the drop down menu to be exact. If you click on it, you will be given options of what kind of charts or graphics that you want and for me I choose Bar vertical stacked to help me visualizing my data.After you choose the type of charts head to the right side of the page and this time we will determined what data will be shown on the chart. I start with the horizontal part of my bar chart and this part, I choose @timestamp and it will shows us timestamp data of the events that happening. The interval that I will be using is 3 hours interval and for the the name that will be displayed is @timestamp failed logon.Horizontal is done, now let’s get the vertical done too. Oh and also just close the horizontal axis menu and choose vertical axis to start customizing it like picture below.Creating New Visualization Chart And Customizing Vertical AxisWe start by choosing Count as the function and the field will be Records. Now the chart would look like what shown in the middle. And there’s one final touch before we done, that is inserting queries. The queries will be data_stream.dataset : windows.security OR data_stream.dataset : system.security OR event.code : \"4625\".Queries For Failed Logon Attempt ChartAnd with those queries, our chart will be more accurate in showing data and gaining hits within the system. Thus, makes us better understand the situation. Now all you need to do now is click on Save and return button, then you will be directed back to the main customization page to naming the panel that we just previously created.New Dashboard Panel NameYou can name it whatever you want, as for me I’ll just name it Logon Failed - Logon Failed Timeline [Windows System Security], and after that just click Save.Now for me, the panels on this dashboard is enough but what’s left is to edit the positioning for the layout of this dashboard. For that, I’ll just start by dragging the panel to where I want it. The dashboard would look like this after I done editing the layout.Failed Attempt Dashboard Finalization EditNow we’re truly done with our dashboard, just save it by clicking Save button on the upper right corner of the page and then a window will pop up for us to entering the name of our dashboard and the description to describing it.Saving DashboardI just naming it Home Lab - Failed Logon Windows and put some description on it. You can just put some name and description on it but be sure to make it meaningful. Now let’s check whether our newly created dashboard is on the list or not. Let’s return back to the dashboard main page and see.New Dashboard On The ListChecking On Success Logon Attempt DashboardNow, let’s check on the successful logon attempt dashboard to see some difference between the failed one. Just click on it on the list and you will inside the edit page of it.Successful Attempt Dashboard PanelWe’re inside it and for us to gaining full access for this page is just by clicking the Edit button on the right corner of the page. After you done switching to Edit mode, let’s observing this dashboard panel.As you can see there’s a couple different from our failed attempt dashboard and that is in this successful dashboard there’s two charts and the details table. The other chart is to track logon event and administrator logon(but I just disabling it because for me I just want full view specifically for the successful logon attempt), as for the details it track the time, username, source IP, and the ID of the winlog.Also, let’s take a closer look of the bar chart and see what is inside of it.Successful Attempt Bar ChartThere’s not much difference from the failed attempt other than the query of event.code is specified to take event 4624 and some parameters like winlog.provider_name : Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing and NOT Logon Failed. Now let’s just head back to the main page.Back to Main PageAnd that’s it, we finally have two dashboard ready to use for tracking logon events from our machine. Just click on Switch to view mode button if you want to exit properly.Final WordsThank you so much for reading this and hopefully you guys gained some knowledge from it and help you using Elastic. Really appreciate your time and see you on the next post.References            References                  Tech with Jono.

    "content": "About This PostThis post made because I thought “Okay, I got my tasked by my workplace to learn how to make Detection Rules and Active Directory. Maybe I could search something on the internet that connect these two?” And to my surprise there’s already someone that did what exactly I thought. Shout out to MyDFIR for the video that I used as my main basis and reference throughout this post.So the project that I will do will mostly following along the MyDFIR tutorial that consist of five parts that you could check here. You could also check his playlist on your own to see what kind of project that suit your need. But for me I’ll just scroll down on that playlist and start on his Active Directory project.MyDFIR Active Directory PlaylistHis project is also serve for my further learning about Brute Force, RDP, Kali Linux and its tools and many more new things for me. So with all of these background being said, I’ll continue to what context you should expect from this post.Context Before We StartThis section is to explain to you guys what you should expect from this post and that is the objective, purpose, and some disclaimer. Okay firstly the objective of this post is to simulating an attacker brute-forcing using RDP to the target machine (Windows). And with the attack being launched, we want to simulate SIEM Detection of it using Elastic while also documenting the detection rule creation, what challenges when making this rule, and some basic case handling.Second, the purpose for this post is to journalizing my learning so that maybe others could learn one or two things from this post. Even if you don’t learn something, well at least I hope you could be entertain seeing me being a complete noob. Lastly, disclaimer. This post by no means is perfect, so take it with a grain of salt and always check whether what I yapped is a mistake or not.With all of that out of the way, lets start the learning.What We Will Be UsingThe machines and tools and that we will be using is consisting of:  Attacker machine: Kali Linux  Target machine: Windows 10 Pro with Active Domain and RDP enabled  SIEM: ELK Stack  Brute force: Hydra  Remote desktop: xfreedp  Log forwarder: Winlog and SysmonThe ingredients is different from what MyDFIR using but the concept and the goals basically the same. So you could also adjusting that list to your need.Preparing Lab DiagramSo after we know what is the tools and machine that we will be using, we need to prepare it first before we start with our project. Firstly we need to have a clear diagram of this whole project. Think of it like a map or instruction that will makes us understand how to navigate and operating this project to meet our need.Project DiagramThis diagram, I make it using draw.io and from it you could see that I plan to use 4 machines in total, Kali Linux(for attacker), Windows 10 Pro and Windows Server 2022 Pro(I’ll tell you the reason on the next section), Ubuntu Server Linux(for ELK stack server). For the IP itself, I’m using DHCP from prefix of my already set NAT network, why DHCP? Because I mostly see people on production stage use DHCP(but half of the reason is that I’m lazy to think of network).Why we need internet here? Aren’t we running it locally? Well yes, it still running locally but the internet is used for downloading for updating dependencies, downloading and communication between machines. The diagram now done, next we preparing the machines.Story Time And Kill Chain DiagramLet’s add story for this project for the funni, so two weeks ago, a junior IT admin proposing a resignation after being denied a promotion. But day before his official resigning, the SIEM begins logging dozens of failed RDP attempts from an internal IP toward the legacy Windows 10 remote access machine still exposed via port 3389. After several hours, a login is successful — and lateral movement attempts begin. No ransomware deployed… yet.Was this a random brute-force? A targeted attack? An insider handing off credentials? The SOC must act fast — reviewing RDP logs, building custom detection rules, and hunting traces before the attacker escalates privileges or exfiltrate data.To further our understanding of this attack scenario, here’s the kill chain diagram based on LOCKHEED MARTIN cyber kill chain.Kill Chain DiagramAs you can see, the final objective for this lab project is to make adversaries gaining access for our data, so we need to act accordingly to this. Let’s start the lab progress shall we?.Installing The VMs  Remember on the lab diagram section I told that you need to use Windows Pro edition for all of the Windows VMs? That is because the Pro version enabling us to use RDP but the other Windows version won’t. Don’t ask me why but that is just how Microsoft is.For this section I could refer you to follow my two parts blog, part 1 part 2 to preparing our SIEM server and one of the endpoint/target machine. As for Kali Linux installation, you could follow MyDFIR part 2 video at minute 8:58, lastly for the Windows server VM at minute 12:31.  Don’t forget to add NAT networks and port forwarding rules for our VMs able to communicate each other before configuring Windows server.Well, apologize if you felt that I’m so lazy for just referring to that video(which is true) but mostly I felt that there’s no need to ‘reinventing wheel’. And after the installation complete, next we preparing the Windows Server which is on part 4 just follow along his video but for the static IP configuration part just skip it because we using DHCP other than that just follow along the video and we will good to go for our Windows server.  Oh while we’re at it don’t forget to also add Elastic agent and Sysmon on Windows server VM too. The how to do it, you can see it on my part 2 post. This optional but I feel the need to do this to simulate real life scenario.We skipping part 3 of MyDFIR video because he using Splunk and we don’t do that here but if you wish to use Wazuh or any other SIEM feel free to use it. The basic remains the same. And with all of it done, we can move to the fun part part, attacking the Endpoint.Adversaries Commencing The AttackNow at this point we have all the VMs and scenario set in stone, what is left for us is to commence the attacking scenario. And the first phase of the attack is the Recon phase.ReconOn the kill chain diagram it stated that the attacker start by scanning the network IP. How’s the attacker the network IP of that said active directory? It’s suspected there’s an insider informant for the attacker and the fact that the adversaries already inside the internal network really strengthening the suspicious insider among us(I’m sorry for that reference, but I had to).Because the attacker already infiltrating the network and got information of the network IP that being for the active directory, he/she then begin to scan that said IP. Here’s what scanning the IPs would look like from the attacker perspective.Attacker Scanning IP NetworkAttacker Got List of Available IPAs you can see, the tool that being used is netdiscover. This tools allowing the attacker to got clear vision of what is inside the network. The next step is for the attacker to scan what is the port that available on those IPs.Attacker Scanning For Open PortsNow the attacker start scanning what port that available on that IP range using nmap and would you look at that, he already got got so much information. The attacker knows the network got port 3389, 139, 445, 135, and 22. A quick google search will tell you that:  Port 3389: used for remote connection(RDP).  Port 139: used for file sharing, printers, and network for Windows-based system over NetBIOS, basically for older version for Windows version or Unix version.  Port 445: used for file sharing, printers, and network over TCP/IP and more of a modern version.  Port 135: used for allowing clients and server communicate to remote access and management. Or in other word, implement RPC Mapper Service in Windows environment.  Port 22: used for SSH, a secure remote login and command execution.As you can see, so much information gained by the attacker, and by now the attacker knows what IP to attack and that is 192.168.68.2 and 192.168.68.7 because the RDP port is available on it. So now the attacker resume to the next phase.WeaponizationThis is where this blog and part 5 video of MyDFIR differ, if MyDFIR using template word lists while I will be using my own word list because the scenario here the adversaries got information about what is the username and password but not know exactly what is the password. That is why the attacker prepping a list of possible password from the clue given.So here’s how the attacker will be preparing the word list.Attacker Make Password Guess ListAttacker Inserting Possible Password GuessFirst, attacker will make password list consisting possible password guess and combination. Attacker knows this because receiving information that one of the account on the active directory domain is username mrizky and the password is something along mrizkyad abbreviation of mrizky active directory. The attacker also knows that the password is using capital letter and number combination that is why you see the password list having bunch of numbers and capital letter. As for the number of password possibilities, the attacker using 20+ possibilities of guess.Now the attacker ready for the next phase of it’s attack and that is brute forcing their way inside the target machine.Delivery And ExploitationI just combine this two part because the progress is continuous of each other, what I mean by that is we will be using Hydra to brute force and guessing the password from the list and Hydra will shows us what is the correct answer. In MyDFIR video he’s using Crowbar but for me I failed when using it and find success when using Hydra. So lets start the brute force.We know that there’s two target here, 192.168.68.2 and 192.168.68.7 so we will be attacking those two. Starting with 2.Attacking 192.168.68.2Attack that launched to 192.168.68.2 using command sudo hydra -l mrizky -P password.txt -t 4 rdp://192.168.68.2is failed, this caused by either the firewall blocking the inbound traffic, RDP is not enabled, or anything regarding security policy inside this machine. The command consisting of:  -l flag, this flag telling hydra to use username that given to it specifically.  -P flag, this flag telling hydra to use list in form of a file in this case its password.txt.  -t flag, this flag telling hydra to tried four times for each attempt of brute force.  rdp://IP_ADDRESS flag, this flag telling hydra to use RDP targeted to the IP being given.More about available flag of Hydra can be read on official page of it.Next we’ll attack 192.168.68.7.Attacking 192.168.68.7Now it’s a success! Let me attempt to explain a bit what happen here in this succeed attempt. The line where [3389][rdp]…… is where Hydra attacking the port that attached on that IP using one of the password that given in the list mrizky4d. And it failed but the next line it says the connection is failed right? That is either because the connection is bad or RDP rejecting another connection attempt, RDP is really sensitive about this by default.And Because the Hydra on the background running through the list checking all of the possible password is why the next line we got success notification in colored highlight. The password is mR1zKyaD, this is why I combined delivery and exploitation because the it can be executed simultaneously. Next let’s see the attacker using xfreedp to remotely entering the machine.InstallationAll the important information is acquired, next that left is for attacker entering the machine and let’s see how it is done.RDP Connection EstablishedFrom the picture you can see the attacker using xfreerdp3 tool and the command is sudo xfreerdp3 /v:192.168.68.7 /u:mrizky /p:mR1zKyaD.  /v flag is signalling to xfreerdp3 to attempting connection to the given IP.  /u flag is signalling to xfreerdp3 to use username being given.  /p flag is signalling to xfreerdp3 to use password being given.And from the look of it, the attacker now successfully connected and being given prompt to end other user that currently logged in as you can see from the picture below.RDP Connection EstablishedFrom the picture let’s just assume that whoever currently using the machine thinking that maybe this is from IT department wanted to log in, so he/she just accepting the connection. When the current user accepting it, here’s what it looked like on the attacker side.Attacker Connected To The MachineAfter the connection is established, the attacker finally inside the machine.Attacker Inside of The MachineAt this stage, the victim is at attacker mercy, because from this point on attacker successfully infiltrating the system and can do whatever possible.C2 With Actions On ObjectivesAgain, I combining this 2 phases because to my understanding this two phases as I practice it, it correlate with each other. Why? Because when attacker dropping the backdoor it also mean that accessing data is available and any other feature inside the machine. Let us see from the attacker perspective.Attacker Dropping Backdoor ScriptThe attacker making bat file in the C:\\Users\\&lt;victim&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup with script powershell -windowstyle hidden -command \"Start-Sleep 5; Start-Process calc\". The script basically will automatically open calculator when user mrizky login to the machine.  This script will only running when user mrizky logged in to the machine. If you use other user it will not running.The Script Executed When LoginYou guys see the script got executed right? This will opening calculator application and I try to simulate the attacker attempting another login using xfreerdp and the script successfully executed. This is just one simple example of an attacker planting some script. The script I shows in this project is just a harmless one that opening calculator(this is to match my skill that is just a noob in cyber security field) but imagine if the attacker is more skilled? How destructive could it be eh?Final Words About The AttackWith it the attack is done now. Quite fantastic and mind blowing I’d say to be able done this project because with this project I could picturing how is the attacker mindset actually got in action. But how about from the defender side?(Blue Team) I’ll show you guys how’s from the blue team side would look like.Defender Defending The SystemFrom the defender side we will see how them preventing, securing, monitoring, and maintaining the system from the attacker. From my understanding I would like to show you guys how can defender preventing and defending from some of the key phase from the attacker so that we could securing the the system. Without further ado, let’s get into it.As I’m using Elastic as SIEM, we will take a look how Elastic work, and better way to showcasing it by showing the dashboard that using queries to will help us taking information about event, logs, and other process on our endpoint machines. Here’s some of the queries that will help us achieving that.      event.category : \"network\" and destination.port : * and network.transport : \"tcp\" for querying TCP activities. This query would help us scanning the activities of network that using TCP protocol. Why TCP? Because from nmap documentation they usually using TCP for their traffic, so I my guess is that we will focusing on the TCP. I also basing this query that I make from this rule from Elastic.TCP Connection Activity        event.code : 4625 AND winlog.event_data.LogonType : (\"3\" or \"10\") for querying failed remote connection attempt. I make this query because from the Windows official documentation about log on type 4625, it is a failed log and the type for remote connection is 3 and 10. So I just using the type with operator OR so that it could catch both or one of it.Failed Remote Login Attempt        event.code : 4624 AND winlog.event_data.LogonType: (\"3\" or \"10) for querying successful remote connection. From the documentation other than different ID number and this time its successful login, it’s basically just the same with failed log on attempt query.Successful Remote Connection        file.extension : (\"bat\" OR \"ps1\" OR \"lnk\") for querying script powershell execution. For this query, I just go simple and straight specifying the type of the file. I mean it’s not everyday someone would executing bat file or ps1(PowerShell) file right? So we could just heavily suspecting it to be suspicious activities.Executed PowerShell Script  With all of those query that I could think of, this is some of the steps that I come up with as Junior SOC Analyst would do, is to first as you can see testing whether the query is getting hit and from all of the picture above it is proven we got hit. So next thing to do for me is to make Rules for those queries.We go to Security tab inside the hamburger menu, next click on Alerts menu and then go to Rules page. We then would arrive in the dashboard of Rules where we can create the rules that we wanted.Rules Dashboard PageFrom that dashboard you can see that I already make one of the rules, but don’t worry I’ll show you how to do it and first click on Create new rule, we will then presented the options and setting for us to make the rules. I will show you how to make first rules, start with the prevention of Reconnaissance phase of the attacker and that is for detecting network and port scanning attempt based on the information that we got. Just follow along the picture that I show you guys below.      First it will asking you guys to inserting the query, just insert it like this picture.Rules Query Inserted        Next, we will filling in information about what this rule would help us detecting attack type based on MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework. For this I’m referring this rule with Discovery technique attack and also Reconnaissance technique attack because when I read the definition, the description matches with how the attack being executed and operated.  To make this rule more specific I also specifying the sub-technique attack of it to Network Service Scanning/Network Service Discovery, Active Scanning - Scanning IP Blocks.  For the severity level I set it to low because sometimes this rule detecting false positive and to be honest, I’ll learn more about queries in the near future but for my current skill this is what I could think of.Specifying Rule Information      We already got the information, now what we wanted is to set the schedule of how often this rule will be applied and running. For this I highly suggest just got with whatever ideal for you and for me it will be running every 20m with additional check between 1h.Defining Rule Schedule        Final step is to specify what kind of alert application or method that we want to set this rule for help notifying team about our finding using this rule. For me, because I’m in lab environment I’ll just go with no actions. But in real life scenario you could choose from Microsoft Teams, Slack, etc.Rule Action Notification  And that’s it, the rule has been created, next thing left is to make rules for the rest queries. I’ll just showcasing the important part of it because it’s basically same procedures as our first rule.      For detecting brute force attempt rule.Rule Queries Brute Force AttemptRule Information Brute Force Attempt        For detecting external remote access rule.Rule Queries External Remote ConnectionRules Information External Remote Connection        For shell script execution rule.Rule Queries Shell Script ExecutionRule Information Shell Script Execution  And with that, we got ourselves custom rule that matches our condition and need. Let’s see if this rule working as intended or not. To see the result, just click on one of the rule that we make previously in rule dashboard page and Scroll down a bit to see if there’s any result we get. I’ll start with brute force attempt rule because for me this where the attacker start being aggressive.Brute Force Attempt Rule ResultTo see the result just click on View details icon and we will be presented with this menu on the right side of the screen.Taking Action For Rule ResultJust click on the Take action button and select Add to new case. Next is shown on picture below.Filling New Case InformationMaking New CaseAfter we click add new case, we will then have to inserting the case name and description to better explain what is wrong with this case. Next we will see whether the case has been created or not. To do that, head to Cases menu page by clicking the tab on the left and we will see this pages.Cases ListOur new cases successfully added now we can follow its development as other team will be notified by clicking on it(External Remote Connection).Case ManagementBecause I’m just L1 SOC this is as far as I can do for my current skill and knowledge and with that we just have to wait other team confirming our finding.Final WordsThank you so much for following this blog and I hope you guys could learn one or two things from it but if it’s not then at very least I hope I could be entertaining enough with this.

    "content": "A Little ReminderThis is part two, continuation from my previous post(part one) where we walk through installing ELK stack SIEM. On this part two, we will take a look at how to integrating our ELK stack with endpoint, in this case is a Windows VM.We will learn also what is Filebeat, Fleet Server, Elastic Agent, Elastic Integration, and many more tools for getting our lab work as a complete eco system for simulating SOC monitoring, log capturing, threat hunting, and maybe many more in the future. Without further a do, let’s get into it.Creating Administrator UserFor this section we will create administrator user so that instead using superuser account all the time. The reason being is for best practice about privilege(cmiiw). Alright, let’s just login to Kibana first using our superuser like in the screenshot below.Login To Kibana Using SuperuserWith superuser account, we could login to Kibana and start to make new user. In the screenshot shown below we will be greeted with Home page menu, don’t worry if it’s just showing template menu, that is just how it is for fresh installment. Now click on the Hamburger Menu on the left side and there will be more sub-menu. We need to click on Stack Management menu.Heading To Stack Management MenuAfter that, we will be directed to the Stack Management page. Here, there’s so many options for you to set but for now let’s just click on the Users sub-menu on the Security category.Click on Users Sub-menuNext there will be Users being shown. In here, listed various users, each with it’s own roles, status, and etc. Want we want to do here is click on Create user button on the upper right corner.Click on Create userWith that, we will then begin to inputting necessary properties for this planned administrator user. There’s various values and properties that you could play around if you want to set something in the future but for now we just focused on these properties in the screenshot below.Setting Up New Administrator UserWhat basically say to Kibana is that we want this newly created user to have username kibana-lab, password that we set, and the privileges such as beats-admin, kibana_admin, and superuser. From the looks of it, the selected roles is somewhat self-explanatory but if you want to know more of it, here’s the full documentation of it. And with that we could login to the new created user.Creating And Integrating Fleet ServerNow that we have new administrator user, we then could login onto it and start integrating Fleet server to our Ubuntu Server machine. This is where our Elastic agents being managed, more about fleet server could be found here.To add our new Fleet server just head to Management sub-menu inside the hamburger menu and click Fleet just like screenshot below.Fleet Server PageFleet server is need some time to load but once its done, click on Add Fleet Server button, it will then navigate us to this page where we could download Fleet Server installer.Screenshot below shows us that we first need to download the file, for next is to set the ELK stack to Production mode because we have our own certificates that we generated on previous tutorial. And on the fourth steps, we specified the location of where we want to attached our Fleet server host. In here, I insert the address of our Ubuntu Server machine and put it in port 8220 and then clickAdding Fleet ServerNow we go back to our Ubuntu Server VM, head to cd /etc/fleet and insert this command to download the Fleet server:sudo wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-7.17.6-linux-x86_64.tar.gzDownloading Fleet Server/Elastic Agent Installer FiLeAfter done downloading it, we need to extract it using tar command:sudo tar -xvf ./elastic-agent-7.17.6-linux-x86_64.tar.gzExtracting Fleet Server/Elastic Agent InstallerAnd this will make directory named elastic-agent-7.17.6-linux-x86_64, but if you like me and somehow the files is on the Desktop directory of your linux unlike nubb tutorial. Then follow the screenshot below.Moving Fleet Server/Elastic Agent Installer FolderHere’s the steps that you could follows based on that screenshot  ls, I first checking on the files or folders my current directory. With it I could see there’s only 2 inside, which is just tarball of the installer file and the extracted file.  sudo mv elastic-agent-7.17.6-linux-x86_64/ /etc/fleet, is to move the extracted folder to /etc/fleet. Previously failed attempt happen because I don’t include sudo to elevate our privilege.  cd /etc/fleet/elastic-agent-7.17.6-linux-x86_64/, to navigate inside it.After we successfully navigating inside the installer folder, we then could insert these commands shown below.Generating Fleet Server Installation Command And TokenOn the screenshot we could see the command being:sudo ./elastic-agent install --url=https://YOUR_OWN_IP:8220 \\  --fleet-server-es=https://YOUR_OWN_IP:9200 \\  --fleet-server-service-token=YOUR_SERVICE_TOKEN \\  --fleet-server-policy=499b5aa7-d214-5b5d-838b-3cd76469844e \\  --certificate-authorities=\"/etc/fleet/certs/ca/ca,crt\" \\  --fleet-server-es-ca=\"/etc/elasticsearch/certs/elasticsearch.crt\" \\  --fleet-server-cert=\"/etc/fleet/certs/fleet.crt\" \\  --fleet-server-cert-key=\"/etc/fleet/certs/fleet.key\"Keep in mind, dont FORGET change the all of the IP’s to YOUR OWN IP. If we don’t do that, the server won’t be able communicate with the ELK stack. Here’s what it would look like on the terminal.Fleet Server/Elastic Agent Installation ProcessLast steps is to make sure the newly made Fleet server is able to communicate with the rest of our ELK stack. With that being set, go to Fleet page once again and click on the Fleet Settings on the upper right corner of the page. We then being showed this window.Setting Fleet Server AddressMake sure your setting is matched with your own IP, otherwise, the Fleet server will not showing any captured logs like this screenshot below.False IP Address Causing No Logs AppearingAnd lets check on the Fleet server page, it should be succeeded by now.Fleet Server/Elastic Agent Installed SuccessfullyAnd we finally able integrating the Fleet server with our Ubuntu Server machine.Creating Agent Policies And Adding IntegrationNow that the medium to gather and managed the all of the logs has been created, we need to create utilization in order for us to able collecting the logs right? And that is what Agent Policies are, they are a set of input that has been defined in order collecting data according to their configuration. The agents also worked with Filebeat to get specified logs and could be set working in tandem for log ingestion.Before we continue further let’s check on our Fleet server status and see what it’s look like.Fleet Server StatusThe status of our Fleet server is healthy, that itself is self explanatory but there’s also several status such as Unhealthy, Offline. Next we will be adding new policy.Now for us to be able making this policies we need to navigate by clicking Create Agent Policy tab on the Fleet page and then we will be shown this page.Fleet Agent Policies TabOn the image, we also seeing the default policies but what we need is our own custom policy and for that just click on the Create agent policy button for then will be showed Create agent policy window.Creating Agent PolicyI will be naming this policy Windows-Endpoint because we will be putting it on windows endpoint machine for collecting logs. And for the description, fills whatever suits your need. After all of that done, just click Create agent policy. After that the policy will be show up on the page now.And after the policy is available, click on it to configure of basically what integrations we will be putting inside of that policy.Selecting Newly Created PolicyNow we’re in the list page of all the integrations that is inside the Windows-Endpoint. In here we can see various integrations that available, right now only System integration that is available but we will add another integration. Just click on Add integration.Add IntegrationWhen we clicked on it, there will be Browse Integrations page and in here we can search also choose what integration that we would like to add. For us now, we need to search Endpoint Security for us to be able securing windows endpoint, so use the search button to search for it. Once we got the result, just click on it to set it up.Searching Endpoint Security EndpointNow we’re able to configure it to our need, I’ll name it windows-edr-integration, fill the description and lastly choosing previously made policy Windows-Endpoint.Endpoint Security IntegrationAfter all that done, just wait a moment and there will be success notification popped up.Successfully Adding Endpoint Security IntegrationThe window shows up, we will then click on the Add Elastic Agent later button and continue to adding also configuring another integration. The integration this time is Windows integration, that way it will help us collecting logs from our Windows machine. Just repeat the previous steps for adding it and then we will arrived in the setting window just like before.Configuring Windows IntegrationI just named it windows-log-collect for the sake of convenient and then choosing Windows-Endpoint policy. After that, continue to scroll down until you see Show advanced setting and click on it. We will then presented with various input column, we want to search for windows.advanced.elasticsearch.tls.ca_crt properties and in it we will paste C:\\Windows\\System32\\ca.crt path. This path will later be used when we copying the CA certificate from our linux VM to the Windows, but for now just set it. And we done for the Windows integration, just click Save and continue. We done with the needed integration, the integration should be ready to integrated to the target machine but because we don’t install any Windows VM yet, the next step is to install Windows VM.Preparing Windows VMHere comes another VM installation part, so let get this over quickly because it’s basically just the same stuff with the Linux installation.  First we want to download the ISO for Win10, to do that just go to multi-edition download site. Just follow along the instruction on the website.  Now that we downloaded media installation tool, run it and we will be shown window for us choosing what kind of action we want for the media creation tool. We want it to make ISO image for the Windows 10.Choosing Windows 10 Image Format  After the format has been chosen, we then select ISO file to be the media of our image. If you want it, you could also choose USB drive but for now we want it to be a file for our VirtualBox.Creating ISO Image  The EULA pop up, just scroll it until done and click Accept.Accepting EULA  Now we need to specify where we need to put the ISO file on our computer and don’t forget to naming it. With that done, the download then begin.Specifying File Location  When the download is done, head to VirtualBox and then click on Machine &gt; New and then select the newly downloaded Windows ISO image.  Don’t forget to uncheck the Unattended install and begin to set your system requirement, I’ll go with RAM: 4GB, CPUs: 2, Storage: 35 GB.  Now just following along the installation instruction but when you arrived at Which type of installation do you want? part, just choose the Custom: Install Windows only (advanced).  For the allocation of the partition, just use all of it but again, just go with whatever suit you if you want to play around with it.  And just wait for the installation to complete. After it finished, I suggest you disabled your internet momentarily. Why? Because the Windows will bothering you with all of its bullshit setup like Cortana(fucking hate this, it just bloat the Windows), especially they forcing you to make Windows account and we don’t want that. Disabling the internet just skipping all of that hassle. There’s other method tho like inputting Shift + F10 and oobe/bypassnro in the CMD. But for me it’s not working, so I just go with simplest solution.  And now, we done installing Windows VM, here’s what it look like.Windows VM  For me, we not done yet. There’s still one more thing to configure. And that is adding Guest Addition CD image. This adds makes us enable to fixing screen display(I don’t like the display), making us seamlessly changing screen(ALT+TAB), and many more. Just click Devices &gt; Insert Guest Additions CD image.Windows VM  After we done clicking that, there will be ISO image mounted on the Windows machine, just double click on it.Insert Addition Image  Inside the image, we will presented with various installer. Just double click on VBoxWindowsAddition.exe to begin the installation. Just for the installation to complete and after it complete, you will be asked to reboot the Windows VM. Just follow along.Mounting Addition Image  We then could check whether the addition image is installed or not by navigate to View and see if the Virtual Screen 1 has options for various screen resolution. And we done for the VM preparation.Windows Endpoint Preparation For Elastic AgentNow we can start by testing the connection of the Windows VM to the Ubuntu Server VM, where our ELK stack installed.We start by testing connection alongside the port whether it is listening or not. Just insert command Test-NetConnection -port INSERT_RESPECTIVE_PORTS YOUR_OWN_IP(remember to change it to your own IP and port that you want to test).Checking Connection To ELK StackNow we know the connection is succeeded, we then could proceed to installing Sysmon, basically a service for monitoring logs activity of our windows machine. We need to download it through PowerShell as Administrator and then insert these command:  Invoke-WebRequest -URI https://download.sysinternals.com/files/Sysmon.zip -OutFile \"C:\\Program Files\\Sysmon.zip\"  Expand-Archive \"C:\\Program Files\\Sysmon.zip\" -DestinationPath \"C:\\Program Files\\Sysmon\"Downloading SysmonBasically what all of those mean is us to download Sysmon, put it on C:\\Program Files, and extracting it. Now that we got the file, we could then cd \"C:\\Program Files\\Sysmon\" and insert the command:  Invoke-WebRequest -URI https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config/master/sysmonconfig-export.xml -OutFile \"C:\\Program Files\\Sysmon\\sysmonconfig-export.xml\"  ./sysmon.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig-export.xmlExecuting The Template ConfigurationBasically the commands says that we downloading template of Sysmon configuration by github user SwiftOnSecurity and here’s the link of the template.Now we have the template, we need a script to adjusting it, so just enter this Shell command:function Enable-PSScriptBlockLogging{$basePath = 'HKLM:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows' +'\\PowerShell\\ScriptBlockLogging'if(-not (Test-Path $basePath)){$null = New-Item $basePath -Force}Set-ItemProperty $basePath -Name EnableScriptBlockLogging -Value \"1\"}The script basically checking whether if there’s registry key exist or not and if it’s not it will set the boolean condition to True with value 1.Enrolling Elastic AgentThis part where we start by transferring our CA certificate from Ubuntu Server to our Windows but first for extra measure, head to cd /usr/share/elasticsearch and copy ca.crt from there to home directory using sudo cp ca/ca.crt /. If the file is already there then it will showing notification that says there’s already same file but if it’s not then it will succeeded. Next thing to do, we just need enter this command inside the PowerShell as Administrator.scp YOUR_UBUNTU_USERNAME@YOUR_OWN_IP:/ca.crt ./ Copy CA Certificate From Ubuntu ServerThat command telling PowerShell to use secure file transfer protocol to copy a file from the Ubuntu Server VM. And now we will do the same with the within the Ubuntu Server that is to insert this command,  scp YOUR_UBUNTU_USERNAME@YOUR_OWN_IP:/ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/  sudo update-ca-certificatesIt’s just copying file but this time we want to update our certificate in case it still uses old certificate.Copying CA Certificate For Linux Ubuntu ServerDon’t mind the failed first try command, that is happen because I was careless and not include sudo on my command.All that left is to download Elastic agent on our Windows VM:  Start-BitsTransfer -Source https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-7.17.6-windows-x86_64.zip -Destination \"C:\\Program Files\\elastic-agent.zip\"  Expand-Archive \"C:\\Program Files\\elastic-agent.zip\" -DestinationPath \"C:\\Program Files\\elastic-agent\"Download Elastic Agent For WindowsThose two commands is just us telling Windows to download it and extracting Elastic agent file on the given directory. With that, Elastic agent installer is on our machine, then we would like to return to Fleet page in the Kibana, this time we will adding agent. The page would look like this.Adding Agent To WindowsThis page is inside Fleet &gt; Agent Policies Tab &gt; Windows-Endpoint(or your own named Windows endpoint policy). In here we click on Add agent on upper menu. After we click on it, there will be window shows up on our right screen that will instruct us on how to adding agent to our endpoint.Add Agent InstructionWe simply just generate our own enrollment token, also because we already downloading agent installer we just skip to next step that is installation command.Enrollment Installation ComamandWe inserting this command on our PowerShell, basically this command instructing the installer to installing Elastic agent with our address along with attached port, and it’s own enrollment token. And don’t forget to change to it’s directory!.  If your PowerShell location outside on any other directory, insert this command cd C:\\\"Program Files\"\\elastic-agent\\elastic-agent-7.17.6-windows-x86_64. You could replace the 7.17.6 with any other version that you installed.  .\\elastic-agent.exe install --url=https://YOUR_OWN_IP:8220 --enrollment-token=YOUR_OWN_TOKEN. You could also add another flag on that installation command --certificate-authorities=\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\ca.crt\", but for me I just go along with the command given by the Elastic.Enrollment Installation CommandAnd that’s it! Just wait a bit for the installation to finish itself and you got your endpoint integrated with Elastic agent policy. Let’s check on it, see if it’s really installed.Agent Installed SuccessfullyWe finally Done! What a long way huh, you could use this step to add another agent on different endpoint, adding more integration, making another policy and just explore on your own. I really hope this tutorial make you learn something. Before I finish this tutorial, let’s see what would our Kibana catching logs look like.Logs Appearing On KibanaAnother moment of truth, let’s what our progress done for us now. Click on the hamburger menu button, under Kibana menu section click Discover and now you will be shown dashboard.Captured LogsFinal WordsAnd we officially done with the installation series. From here on, you could start your own exploration, see what kind of scenario you want to set up or you could follow part 4 of LevelEffect by William Nissler. This guide is meant to teaching you guys how to catch the fish from my POV. You could also add your own twist but for me the basic stays the same.So again, thank you so much for reading and following this guide and hope you learning something.

    "content": "Before We StartThis section is a explaination for what to expect in this blog and also serve as a shoutouts to all of the peoples that making knowledge in form of tutorials. With that being said, this is some of the people that helps me on this installation:  crin, thank you for making discord server where newbie like me and others could gather and share knowledge.  nubbieeee, thank you so much for reaching out to me on discord. Really appreciate your guide, with it  I’m able to present my progress.  Will Nissler from LevelEffect, thank you for making the tutorial that I could use as a main guideline alongside with nubb tutorial. Your tutorial really have a lot of information.  And other tutorial that I will list on the reference that helps me fix certain error and circumstances that I experience along my installation and setup progress.What To Expect From This GuideThis guide is served as a supplementary and a note for present and future me or maybe others that will or want to start installing Elastic for home lab where it could be used as tools of experimenting and hands on learning of cyber security. By no means this guide is perfect and if you happen to encounter any error, use the material that I listed on the refence section or like the old saying Just google it. Because at the end of the day, cyber security is heavily relied on the so called professional googling. And don’t forget to ask ChatGPT, it really helps to direct you to more accurate answer.I’m planning to make this guide into two parts or maybe more depending on my current assignment given to me. But for the time being it will be just two part. For this part one, I will focusing on installation and setting up the ELK stack and all of the VMs.Some Stuff That You Will LearnThere are some stuff here that I sure you will learn one or two when following this guide, some of it are:  Setting up and configuring VM with VirtualBox.  A bit of networking stuff such as port forwarding, networking.  ELK stack installation and understand how they work.And maybe many more that I couldn’t mention above. Hope this guide become useful for me in the future or for you guys too.Objective of This GuideOkay this will be the last I’ll yap other than the actual guide. So here’s some of the objective for part one of this guide series:  Setting up all of the VMs (i.e. Linux and Windows) to suit the requirement.  Setting up VMs connection configuration.  Installing and configure Elasticsearch on Ubuntu server VM.  Installing and configure Kibana on Ubuntu server VM.  Installing and configure Filebeat on Windows VM.  Successfully login to ELK stack after the installation.Let’s BeginNow in this section, we will begin the installation progress by first understanding what is ELK stack and then understand what this lab looks like on a diagram to further enhance our understanding of this lab. First thing first, what exactly is ELK stack? I’ll add my 2 cents here too since the official documentation already done such great detail in explaining it. Basically ELK is an acronym, Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana and each of that technology is serve their on purposes.Elasticsearch is to search, analyze, and process all of the data that being collected. You could call it the engine of ELK stack and Logstash is the instrument that ingest all of that data from multiple sources to Elasticsearch and when the data arrived in Elasticsearch, it is then can be visualize by Kibana for making user more easy to understand all of those data in form of charts and graphs.DiagramAnd with that explanation in mind, we then could utilize ELK stack as a SIEM to monitor our system. For the system of this lab, I will explain it with the diagram below to better understand the context of what it looks like:Here’s a simple diagram to illustrate our labI admit, it’s not fancy but for me it could convey what our lab will look like and this is as far as my understanding of the lab. But if you want a more detailed overview of the diagram, head to William Nissler guide he got to more detailed about it. So from that diagram, we want to install ELK stack on the ubuntu server with the listed ports and that port will be attached to the DHCP IP.And the ELK stack will receiving log mainly from the Windows VM through sysmon, filebeat, windows event log, and powershell script. And also the Windows VM having the IP received from the DHCP process that can be used to make connection between two VMs. Lastly, the Windows analysis machine is our own PC that act as a monitoring device that can access the ELK stack with the localhost ip. But why localhost you say? To put it simply, we can’t just access the VMs directly because the nature of VM itself.VM is run on their own separate kernel despite it’s still in our machine and that also mean they having their own network too, that is why in the diagram I put router to illustrate this process as router is the device that handling layer 3 i.e. network(IP, etc). And to access that network we have to set the NAT and some ports too if we have to use some protocol. We will go through this more in depth in the next section. But for now, just know that we can’t just access the VMs directly.Linux Ubuntu Server VM InstallationIn this section we will begin first with installing Ubuntu Server for our ELK stack. The Ubuntu Server version that I and some of the guides that I used is 18.04 LTS, the LevelEffect guide didn’t mention any reason as to why choosing this version but seeing the time of the blog being published was in 2022, my guess is version 18.04 is more stable than any version during that time.And if we done choosing the version, here’s some requirement for the Ubuntu VM:            Hardware Requirement                         OS      Ubuntu Server 18.04              RAM      4 GB              CPU      2 Cores              Storage      30 GB      I go with the requirement above because it suits my need and my hardware capability but if guys want to tweak some of the requirement then go ahead. With that being said, the steps for installing Ubuntu server is as follows:  Download it from the official Ubuntu server website.  After done downloading it, we then open VirtualBox and click Machine menu and select New….Selecting Machine To Create New VM  It will then having Create Virtual Machine pop up, with it we could configure and set the properties of the VM. Just put the machine hardware just like our hardware requirement previously. One thing to note here is that, I checked the Skip Unattended Installation because if we want to use unattended installation that mean VirtualBox will handles the installation based on the provided setting and in this case we want to configure it manually.Configuring VM Hardware  Next, the VM will appear on the VirtualBox menu manager, select that and click on Start icon to start the VM installation.  The VM starting and next thing is to select language, select whatever language that suits you but in this case I choose english for obvious reason.  The language set is done, now we will greeted by Ubuntu Server version notification. For our case, just select Continue without updatingSkipping Version Update Selection  Here, there will be IP that we got from DHCP, note it because this is important for basically every next configuration.Receiving IP DHCP  If being asked to choose proxy on the next step, just skip it because we don’t need it.  Also just go with the default mirror link. Basically this is just Ubuntu asking for sources to download its dependencies and packages.  The next menu is storage partition. For me personally I’ll just go with the default but feel free if you guys want to get creative with it.  Okay, next is configuring username and password for the Ubuntu. Remember also to make password that easy to remember but also not too easy to guess(it will be used a lot in the next steps). For this section, I’ll configure it like shown below but then again, feel free just go with something you guys want.Creating Account For Ubuntu  The account has made, we then continue to enabling SSH for this Ubuntu.Selecting Enable SSH  All of that has been done then we wait for the installation to finish. It will somewhat look like this or similar.Ubuntu Server Successfully InstalledNow with the installation complete I’ll add one more important thing to do before we proceed further. I want you guys make snapshot for each section of this guide. Yep, this will serve as a failsafe incase something went wrong, making it “point of return” for us(yes pun intended). Here’s how to do it:  Click on Machine menu again and select Take Snapshot…Selecting Take Snapshot  After that there will be menu pop that want us to name the snapshot. The name will function as a description for what exactly is this snapshot that we make. So make sure the name and description is informative about what machine situation when the snapshot being made. Making Snapshot Name and DescriptionAnd with that our Ubuntu Server is done we could continue to next step, that is updating our Ubuntu with this commands. But we need to login to our Ubuntu. After done login, execute these steps:Disclaimer for sudo CommandFrom here on we will using A LOT really a lot sudo and it will often asking to enter our root password(same with your user password) that is why I said to use easy to remember password previously. Basically we want to minimize access to our root as little as possible because security concern(shoutout to nubb, thanks for the insight). Okay, on with the guide.  Enter command sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y. These commands will update and upgrading our existing packages.  Next command sudo apt dist-upgrade -y. Same with previous but the difference is, this command will handle changes of the packages if necessary.  sudo apt install zip unzip -y is the next command, this command installing zip and unzip application for us to be able extracting zip format file and compressing file into it.  Lastly there’s sudo apt install jq -y that used for JSON parsing and transformation. It’s just a fancy words that means our Ubuntu able to interact with JSON format file.With all of that being done, our Ubuntu is ready. Oh, and don’t forget to make snapshot here too just to be extra careful if you guys want.Accessing Machine Through SSHChecking Ubuntu SSHThis section will focusing on SSH thingies, starting from checking it’s status, setting up NAT rules, and many more. I recommend using SSH to simulate remote connection within work environment and to avoid hassle of interacting directly with the VirtualBox(yes, it’s such a pain in the ass). But first thing first, login to the Ubuntu VM and execute this steps:  First, we have to check our Ubuntu SSH status. There’s some possibilities here, either our SSH is working or not. Let’s make sure of it with this command, sudo systemctl status ssh. On my case, the SSH is Active and running like shown below.Making Snapshot Name and DescriptionThis is because we enabling SSH previously during our installation but in case if some of you guys seeing failed or dead status proceed to next steps.  Execute this command sudo apt-get remove --purge openssh-server &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install openssh-server. That commands(I use plural here because there’s two command that being fused together with &amp;&amp; operator) basically the commands will first remove and deleting all of the SSH files, service, etc and then installing it again.  When it is done, you guys could run sudo systemctl status ssh and you should see a dead status but don’t worry, execute sudo systemctl enable ssh to enable the service and then systemctl start ssh to start it again. And now next check it’s status again, it should be running now. Don’t forget to make snapshot 📷 .Network And SSH ConfigurationEven with all of that progress previously, we still couldn’t even access the VM directly by their IP, nuh uh that would be too convenient. Welcome to IT world, where if it’s not pain in the ass you should suspect somethings wrong. So how do we SSH the VM then? well let’s get into it:  First head to our VirtualBox Manager menu and select the network option shown below.Selecting Network Menu      After that there will be network menu, in it select NAT Network tab and click on Create icon to create new NAT Networks option.Configuring NAT NetworkFrom the image above, we basically configuring our NAT Network to named “ElasticNetwork” to the network IP within prefix of 192.168.68.0/24 with DHCP server enabled. Below it, we could see there’s Port Forwaring tab where you could add by clicking on the green plus icon and set it’s name, the protocol which is TCP for SSH, host IP being left blank because we want it to be able receiving any IP other from the prefix range, the host port, guest IP with our own Ubuntu IP previously, and lastly the guest port being 22.    Next is to set our network mode for our Ubuntu VM, again we head to Machine &gt; Settings on our VM windows and after that select Network like shown below.Setting Ubuntu Network ConfigurationChange the Attached to with NAT Network, name change it with the network that we make, and lastly I set the Promiscous Mode to Allow All. That make sure it could capture all traffic because well, this is a SIEM lab.Successfully SSH To Ubuntu VMNow all of that done, finally we are able to SSH to the VM and maybe some of you wondering why the IP is 127.0.0.1 and not 192.168.68.5? Well according to the guides that I read, this is possible because the port forwarding rules that we set before that allowing all IP to access SSH to Ubuntu VM through port 2222 which then being redirected to port 22. And 127.0.0.1 itself is another way of saying localhost. I’ve tried to access it with IP 192.168.68.5 but there’s no connection, I still dunno why is that happen even though I’ve tried to add rules for it¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. But oh well, maybe I’m just that noob. Oh and don’t forget to make snapshot 📷.Setting Up ElasticsearchOkay, now the nitty gritty part of it, buckle up and prepare to get your hands dirty because there will be a lot to configure. Oh and we will continue this part on SSH connection.Downloading and Installing ElasticsearchBut before we start downloading Elasticsearch, execute this command sudo apt install apt-transport-https -y to enabling us using APT transport for the HTTPS protocol which is a more secure version of HTTP and for the GPG key of the Elasticsearch. Again, some security stuffs and best practice.Okay, below is screenshot and steps for Elasticsearch installation:Successfully Downloading Elasticsearch  First we download GPG key for the Elasticsearch with command wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -  Next, to see if the repo is exist for our Ubuntu echo \"deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list.  Now, with all of that done we could update and install Elasticsearch sudo apt update -y &amp;&amp; sudo apt install elasticsearch -yDone and with that we could see the status of Elasticsearch service just like SSH previously with command sudo systemctl status elasticsearch.service.Checking Elasticsearch Service StatusAs you can see, the status is dead and that is because still haven’t enabling the service yet, that will be done on the next section.Configuring Elasticsearch And Checking It’s ConnectionBefore we enabling and running the service, let’s configure Elasticsearch first to suit our need like changing it’s address, protocols, ports, etc.We could do that by entering command sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml. Let me explain a bit that command, basically we accessing elasticsearch.yml with super user privilege, then choosing our text editor for mine it’s nano but you could choose other text editor, and lastly we specifying the filepath of elasticsearch.yml to be able to open it.After that done, you should see the text editor open up and you could start changing the properties such as shown below:Changing Elasticsearch PropertiesWhat we’re changing here is:  cluster.name to our own wanted name.  network.host to our own IP.  http.port is just commented out because this will be default value of 9200.  discovery.type is the last. This is for Elasticsearch to know whether we run a single node or multiple. More of it can be read hereWith this we then could do these following steps:Enabling Elasticsearch Service And Testing It’s Connection  We first enable the service with sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.  Then we start it sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.  After that, checking its status sudo systemctl status elasticsearch.  Finally we check the connection with curl --get http://YOUR_OWN_IP:9200. Change YOUR_OWN_IP with the IP you got from DHCP previously.Setting Up KibanaNow, we do the same with Kibana, take a look this screenshot below.Successfully Installing KibanaEnter command sudo apt install kibana -y and wait for it to finish the process. After that we edit the Kibana YML configuration, enter command sudo nano /etc/kibana/kibana.yml disclaimer again, nano is my text editor choice.Changing Kibana YML PropertiesIn here, we change:  server.port, we just commented it out because we will be using it’s default properties.  server.host, change it again to your own IP.  server.name, change it to your desire.Kibana CredentialsAs for Kibana credentials, we just leave it for now. We will back to it in the later steps. And with that, let’s continue next step that is enabling Kibana service.Enabling Kibana Service  We always start with enabling service first, sudo systemctl enable kibana.  Then start it’s service sudo systemctl start kibana.  And finally checking it’s status with sudo systemctl status kibana.And that’s it, we finally installed Elasticsearch and Kibana. You could also checking Elasticsearch and Kibana status both at the same time with sudo systemctl status elasticsearch &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl status kibana. And as always don’t forget to take snapshot 📷.Important NoteThis section is for those who are done for the day of configuring this lab and want to take a rest or any other task. If you want to stop, you have to shutdown all of the component properly, here’s how you do it.Shutting Down System ProperlyThe command used is in order, so first it’s sudo systemctl stop kibana and the second is sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch. This way we could safely shut down our system without worrying the risk to break anything. And another note, kibana.service == kibana &amp;&amp; elasticsearch.service == elastic.And if you guys want to continue again:  sudo systemctl start elasticsearch  sudo systemctl start kibanaSetting Up FilebeatSame thing with previous installation steps, enter sudo apt install filebeat -y, wait for the process to be done and edit the YML file sudo nano /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml.Inside filebeat.yml file we could adjust and change variety of input received by Elasticsearch from journald, winlog,  Windows event logs, and many more. Winlog helps us captures more log data beyond just logged events. The guides that I follow mostly using Filebeat to collect it’s log, so let’s just focus on that too.What you have to edit in the filebeat.yml is as followsChanging Filebeat HostsWe change that to our own IP that attached to Elasticsearch port 9200. And the next thing to is shown in screenshot below.Disabling Logstash And Checking The Connection To ElasticAccording to the guides that I follows, this is to disable Logstash and to ensure Filebeat correctly connected to Elasticsearch. We use sudo filebeat setup --index-management -E output.logstash.enabled=false 'output.elasticsearch.hosts=[\"YOUR_OWN_IP:9200\"]'.Next we enable the service sudo systemctl enable filebeat.service and we start it sudo systemctl start filebeat.service. Lastly we use curl --get http://YOUR_OWN_IP:9200/_cat/indices?v, that command simply making an API call of the URL and printing it out in verbose but also in column format. Making it more readable. The health here is just indicator of shards whether it’s condition is healthy, caution or danger but as far as I know, this not really mean much. So don’t mind it. Oh and don’t forget to take snapshot 📷.CA Certificate Authorities Configuration and Elastic IPBut why making CA certificate even though Elastic come with it’s own default certificate? To my knowledge the default protocol when access Elastic is HTTP but we want it to be HTTPS, so this is where CA certificate comes in handy. With it, we could enabling HTTPS connection.Now, without further a do, use cd /usr/share/elasticsearch to navigate to elasticsearch directory and enter sudo touch instances.yml and then open the text editor sudo nano instances.yml. After opening the file, insert this propertiesinstances:        - name: \"elasticsearch\"          ip:                  - \"YOUR_OWN_IP\"        - name: \"kibana\"          ip:                  - \"YOUR_OWN_IP\"        - name: \"fleet\"          ip:                  - \"YOUR_OWN_IP\"The IP inserted there is for fleet service able to reach out to it and make CA certificate according to the given IP there. Before exiting, save that file. And yeah, if you want, don’t forget to take snapshot 📷.Time to Create CA Certificate and Other CertificatesSo next is to generate and create other certificates as well, head to cd /usr/share/elasticsearch and we enter command sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-certutil ca --pem. That basically mean we using executable file that generate the certs itself, and the encryption format of are X.509. Which is a public key certificates used in TLS/SSL, and HTTPS as well to secure the web, more about that can be found here. As for the --pem itself, it’s a standard file format of storing and sending encrypted key and certificate. And with that, we will get output as follows:CA Certificates OutputOne more thing to know based on that output, we using the instances.yml that made previously to help us generate these certificates. And we compressing it in zip file format, as for the file name I choose to name it elastic-stack-cat.zip but you can choose whatever name convenient to you. With it, we enter sudo unzip elastic-stack-ca.zip to unzipping the file.Nicely done, next steps is to put use of these certificates by using it to generate private key and another certificates. Use this command sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert --ca-cert ca/ca.crt --ca-key ca/ca.key --pem --in instances.yml --out cert.zip. Follow the screenshot below.Generating Private KeysI’ll go with cert.zip as the name but and I we also need to unzipping this file too. And after that we need to use command sudo unzip cert.zip to unzipping it.Unzipping Cert And Making Directory CertNotice that Linux making it’s own directory after unzipping it, because of that the next thing is to move all of those certificates to our newly created directory. We make directory to store all those certificates with sudo mkdir certs, after the directory created use sudo mv /usr/share/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/* certs/ first, then sudo mv /usr/share/elasticsearch/kibana/* certs/, lastly sudo mv /usr/share/elasticsearch/fleet/* certs/. After the copying steps done, we then use sudo mkdir -p /etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca &amp;&amp; sudo mkdir -p /etc/kibana/certs/ca &amp;&amp; sudo mkdir -p /etc/fleet/certs/ca to make CA own directory just like screenshot below where we could store our CA certificates.The CA directory has been made, now we copy CA certs and other certificates to their respective directory with these command.  sudo cp ca/ca.* /etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca &amp;&amp; sudo cp ca/ca.* /etc/kibana/certs/ca &amp;&amp; sudo cp ca/ca.* /etc/fleet/certs/ca  sudo cp certs/elasticsearch.* /etc/elasticsearch/certs/ &amp;&amp; sudo cp certs/kibana.* /etc/kibana/certs/ &amp;&amp; sudo cp certs/fleet.* /etc/fleet/certs/I used list command to check the directory and noticing that there’s still certs directories left around. So lastly just like mom used to say, clean up after playing with your toy and like a good kid we are we clean up our mess with sudo rm -r elasticsearch/ kibana/ fleet/Moving The Certificates FilesAlso don’t forget to take snapshot 📷 hehehehe.Best Practice For SIEM DeploymentThis section is for us to implement best practice when we deploying SIEM is to have least privilege within our systems and according nubb, the PrintNightmare threat is still lurking rampant out there so gotta be careful. More about that you could read here.And this also correlate with our usage of sudo command where we want the least privilege. With that in mind, head to cd /usr/share and execute commands:  sudo chown -R elasticsearch:elasticsearch elasticsearch/,  which will recursively set the ownership of the elasticsearch.  sudo chown -R elasticsearch:elasticsearch /etc/elasticsearch/certs/caThe first command let us set the elasticsearch directory to Elasticsearch and also change its group to elasticsearch that helps us limit permission to again, Elasticsearch. Second command is doing the same thing but for ca directory.Best Practice SIEM DeploymentBased on that screenshot, the command being used is sudo openssl x509 -in /etc/elasticsearch/certs/elasticsearch.crt -text -noout. Where there’s couple of command flag that I want to explain to the best of my understanding. -in flag used to specifying the certificate to check out, -text to make the output in readable format and lastly -noout is basically minimizing the gibberish encoded message to help further making it more readable.Setting Up HTTPS Connection With the CertificatesFirst head to the kibana.yml file with sudo nano /etc/kibana/kibana.yml and we copy this YML script below:server.ssl.enabled: trueserver.ssl.certificate: \"/etc/kibana/certs/kibana.crt\"server.ssl.key: \"/etc/kibana/certs/kibana.key\"elasticsearch.hosts: [\"https://YOUR_OWN_IP:9200\"]elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities: [\"/etc/kibana/certs/ca/ca.crt\"]elasticsearch.ssl.certificate: \"/etc/kibana/certs/kibana.crt\"elasticsearch.ssl.key: \"/etc/kibana/certs/kibana.key\"server.publicBaseUrl: \"https://YOUR_OWN_IP:5601\"xpack.security.enabled: truexpack.security.session.idleTimeout: \"30m\"xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: \"min-32-byte-long-strong-encryption-key\"Remember to change YOUR_OWN_IP to your own IP and also some of you might notice that I input 10.0.2.15 as the IP right? Well that just me being dumbo and you will see what happen when you don’t correctly set the IP in the next section. And all of These properties is all within the kibana.yml but it will be pain in the ass to search each of it and editing them so yeah, just copy that. And it will look like this.Configuring Kibana SSLThe properties here somewhat self explanatory, the public base URL is our Kibana address, and others is for our encryption thingies.  But albeit, I agree with nubb here, I was also confused when first time handling the certificates and encryption stuff of ELK stack. But basically it’s just how Kibana telling Elastic that the communication between them is secured with various encrypted certificates and that Kibana make sure, it is trusted Kibana that talking with Elasticsearch.Or, cmiiw that is just how I understands these whole shenanigan. Proceed to next step that is basically the same but for elasticsearch.yml. sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml and start add the properties.xpack.security.enabled: truexpack.security.authc.api_key.enabled: truexpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: truexpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode: certificatexpack.security.transport.ssl.key: /etc/elasticsearch/certs/elasticsearch.keyxpack.security.transport.ssl.certificate: /etc/elasticsearch/certs/elasticsearch.crtxpack.security.transport.ssl.certificate_authorities: [\"/etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca/ca.crt\"]xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: truexpack.security.http.ssl.verification_mode: certificatexpack.security.http.ssl.key: /etc/elasticsearch/certs/elasticsearch.keyxpack.security.http.ssl.certificate: /etc/elasticsearch/certs/elasticsearch.crtxpack.security.http.ssl.certificate_authorities: [\"/etc/elasticsearch/certs/ca/ca.crt\"]Configuring Elasticsearch SSLI’ll leave the official documentation for you to read more information and nubb explanation about this SSL things. And I agree again with nubb here, are the Elastic devs high on something when making the script to not use quotation for file path? Only God and them knows why.With that said and done, we have to sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch and next sudo systemctl restart kibana on respective order for enabling us applying the changes. With that don’t forget to take snapshot 📷.Testing Connections to ElasticsearchNow let’s what all of these headache got us. Execute the command curl --get https://YOUR_OWN_IP:9200.Testing ConnectionsNotice that it failed for the first time? Yeah, like I said, if it’s too good to be true in IT, chances are you missing something. Apparently the reason for the failed testing is because while the Kibana and Elasticsearch trust each other, the browser is don’t.Kinda like when you bring your other friend to your other friend, of course they still don’t trust each other instantly right?. That is why as their friend you would say “Trust me bro, this kid is good” and that is exactly what we would do with the command curl --get https://10.0.2.15:9200 --insecure | jq the --insecure is the “trust me bro” in this case where we bypassing it temporarily and as for the jq telling the output to make on JSON format. This why we install JSON packages previously.Creating CredentialsNow one more thing before we see ELK stack frontend, we have to generate credential in order to login to ELK stack. Here’s the command sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto and basically this means we let the Elastic generate it for us. All the information about it can be found here. Here’s what it will look likeGenerated CredentialsAnd don’t forget to save all of that credentials, oh and also don’t change the elastic.username but just change password of it to the generated password previously. The ELK stack will stuck on endless loop if you don’t change those two properties. The elastic username used for superuser and it basically the core user of ELK. Changing it will make ELK stack error.Now with all of that restart the ELK stack with sudo systemctl restart kibana &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch.Now we ready to login ELK stack and using it. But before that, don’t forget to take snapshot 📷.Rule Forwarding For ELKOne last setting that we need to set before connecting to ELK stack is to add another port forwarding rules but this time for the connection to ELK stack. For the sake of simplicity, here’s the step below.Adding ELK Connection In Port Forwarding RuleTo add the rule above, we head to Virtual Box Manager just like previously we add SSH rule and then select Network &gt; NAT Network &gt; select Port Forwarding tab &gt; and click on the green plus icon. Just like that, we add the rule just like shown picture above. Finally, with this we could connecting to the ELK stack.Moment of TruthOh and if you just start again don’t forget to start the ELK stacks. I’ll explain it further but take a look this screenshot.Let The Browser Trust The ConnectionThe browser showing that because it still don’t trust the ELK stack connection yet and warning us. But we know this is a trusted connection and let the browser know that by clicking Advanced… and Accept the Risk and ContinueKibana Server Not Ready YetInteresting that we access it with https://127.0.0.1:5601 but not with YOUR_OWN_IP. Why is that? Well, that is because the ELK stack hosted on your own IP but not accessible publicly, that is why accessing it locally with 127.0.0.1. And what’s that not ready yet message? Welp, just like the name suggested, the system is indeed not ready yet, maybe warm up or smth ¯/_(ツ)_/¯.We a bit and….. voilà, the ELK stack front ladies and gentlemen. Phew… that was long journey huh? Nicely done guys.ELK Stack Finally Able To UseWhat’s About the Wrong IP Before?This last section is to explanation the silliness that made previously by entering wrong IP. Basically what will happen is that ELK stack will infinitely on Not Ready Yet status and to fix it?Infinite Kibana Server Not Ready YetTo fix it we have to change it back to your correct IP in kibana.yml like shown in the picture below.Change that 10.0.2.15 With Your Own IpAnd that 10.0.2.15 needed to be change to your own IP. With that, you finally fixing the Not Ready Yet status.Last Words and ReferencesThank you so much for spending your time following and reading through all of the yapping from me.

    "content": "Detecting My First EventFirst time I’m diving into cyber security and being tasked to explore Elasticsearch and it’s functionality, that is where I’m really in a dark as to how and where to begin with this journey ahead. But then I watch some videos on youtube and in it Elasticsearch can be used for events detection. At that time, there’s a light bulb lights up on my mind because I thought to myself “How about I simulate a basic events using this local Elasticsearch that I’ve just installed and see what is it looks like in the Kibana? And along the way I could also learn other cyber security concept. Two birds with one stone” I said to myself.My Thought Process Looks like This Fr FrSo with this post I’ll explain and walk through about what is my setup for this scenario, the configuration for the setup, what kind of queires for logs that I used, what I learn from this little experiment, and some bits about what I should know more. So if you feels like just like me, new to Elasticsearch as SIEM or maybe just cyber security in general especially blue team, I hope this experience of mine helps you.What Is Event ID 4624 &amp; 4625? And Why Need To Detect Them?So for starter, all of the processes and events that is happening inside the computer are being recorded and stored in a form of logs that being specified by the system’s audit policy. And that is called Windows Security Logs, where it’s offer an immense amount of insight into what’s happening on a computer/machine. Our so called ‘main highlight’ for today is event ID 4624 &amp; 4625.But before we delve more in event ID 4624 &amp; 4625, let me explain what exactly does ‘ID’ means here. So in term of windows event logging, ‘ID’ is referring to unique identifier that uniquely identifies particular events that help define it’s description so that viewers can present these description to the user and thus helping user solving their own problems.And with that said definition we could finally explain and understand better what are those two events exactly.  ✅ Event ID 4624 – Successful Logon          Generated when user logs on successfully to a computer/machine.      This is very Useful for understanding who logged in, from where, and using what method.        ❌ Event ID 4625 – Failed Logon          Generated when a logon attempt fails by user.      Extremely useful for detecting brute force attacks, incorrect password attempts, or even internal misuse.      And with that information and adding documentation from Microsoft’s official documentation and the event ID reference, we could at least expect the information would be provided with fields like:      TargetUserName: Who tried to log in        IpAddress: From where        LogonType: What method (RDP, Interactive, Network, etc.)        FailureReason: For 4625, why the login failed        ProcessName: What app triggered the login  As we can see, the information really essential for us to help spot some patterns, suspicious behaviour or unsual acitivity in general.The Necessary ToolsFor the stack that I used in this little project to gather, store, and visualize the logs being gathered are as follows:      Winlogbeat (Agent installed on Windows host)        Elasticsearch (Storage &amp; querying engine)        Kibana (Dashboard for data exploration)        Windows Installed Device(Generating real login events)  This stack is a part of the Elastic Stack (ELK), which is widely used for log management and lightweight SIEM purposes.Step-by-Step Setup  ✍️ Step 1: Install Winlogbeat on the Windows HostDownload and install Winlogbeat from the official Elastic downloads page.Edit the configuration file (winlogbeat.yml):winlogbeat.event_logs:  - name: Security    event_id: 4624, 4625Specify the destination for Elasticsearch:output.elasticsearch:  hosts: [\"http://localhost:9200\"]Enable the Winlogbeat service:.\\winlogbeat.exe install-serviceStart-Service winlogbeatNow that the winlog is set, we then can proceed to next step. Connecting the winlog to Elasticsearch and Kibana.      🔗 Step 2: Connect Elasticsearch and Kibana                  Ensure Elasticsearch is up and running: http://localhost:9200                    Open Kibana: http://localhost:5601                    Navigate to Stack Management &gt; Index Patterns and create a pattern like winlogbeat-*            Start Querying Those Windows Logon Events in KibanaWith all of the setup being done and Kibana is ready to use, head to Discover menu on the Kibana like in the picture below.Kibana Discover Working Properly Showing Logs &amp; EventsAfter inside the Kibana Discover tab, we could see all of what’s happening inside our machine/computer. This will give us a clear information to pin point the threats, adverseries, and any other suspicious activies.The next steps to see the wanted events is to input the queries. We can input the queries like shown in the picture below alongside the necessary queries.Successfully Filtering Event ID 4624The language being used in the picture above is called KQL(Kibana Query Language) but before we continue with the event. Let me briefly expalain what is KQL in my understanding.  🧠 So What is KQL (Kibana Query Language)?It’s a set of search syntax in Kibana to filter and explore log data within Kibana that is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly for analysts to be able build queries without writing complex raw Elasticsearch DSL.They way it being structured is by having field-based searches, logical operators, and even wildcards to filter events quickly. Here’s the composition of it explained in table form:            Component      Example      Description                  Field match      event.code: \"4624\"      Match entries where event.code is exactly 4624.              AND / OR operators      event.code: \"4625\" AND winlog.event_data.LogonType: \"10\"      Combines multiple conditions. AND = both must match. OR = either one.              Grouping values      event.code: (\"4624\" or \"4625\")      Matches either value in a field.              Wildcard search      TargetUserName: \"admin*\"      Matches values that start with admin (e.g., administrator, admin1).              Phrase match      ProcessName: \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\svchost.exe\"      Searches for exact phrases, often used with file paths.              Negation      NOT TargetUserName: \"SYSTEM\"      Excludes logs where username is SYSTEM.              Time range      @timestamp &gt;= \"now-1d/d\"      Shows only logs from the last day. Supports relative time filtering.      How To Simulate Event ID 4625With the knowledge of how KQL structured and compose we can now then simulate how to make the event appear. Because event 4624 is a success logon, for this section I try to emulate event 4625. This is because currently I’m using one machine/computer only.There’s various way to emulate it, here are some of it:  Using Runas with Wrong Password          Open CMD or PowerShell      Run the following command on it runas /user:fakeuser cmd      When prompted, enter any password (wrong is fine).        Create a Dummy Local Account, Then Log in WrongIf it need to be more realism:                  Create a dummy user using PowerShell(run as administrators):net user admin P@ssword123 /add            Now try logging in with this account using the wrong password:                  Lock screen (Win + L) → switch user → admin                    Try logging in with wrong credentials:                  Use something like admin123 as the username and any wrong password.                    Delete the account after testing:                  net user admin /delete                     What Is It Looks Like Inside Discover in Kibana?And with that being done, we then can proceed to monitor the activity using some of the queries. Here’s some explame of it:  All successful logins    event.code: \"4624\"        Failed logins via local    event.code: \"4625\" AND winlog.event_data.LogonType: \"2\"        Filter out noise from system accounts    NOT TargetUserName: \"SYSTEM\" AND event.code: \"4625\"        Failed login attempts where the username starts with “admin”    user.name : \"admin\" AND event.code: \"4625\"        Failed logins from the last hour    @timestamp &gt;= \"now-1h/h\" AND event.code: \"4625\"      And that’s some queries that I tried to shows the regarding events on this little experiment of mine.Insights &amp; Lessons LearnedHere’s what I learned while building this setup:      Elasticsearch is flexible: You can query just about anything if you understand the schema.        Fields matter: Understanding LogonType, TargetUserName, and ProcessName can surface important patterns.        Kibana makes learning fun: Seeing the data visually helped me internalize the concepts faster.        Winlogbeat is efficient: It shipped the logs reliably with minimal config and resource usage.        Also: filtering out logon attempts from Anonymous users or from NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM helped clean up the data.  What I Still Don’t Know (Yet)This little experiment raised more questions that I’d like to explore:      How can I set up alerts for excessive 4625s in a short time? (e.g., brute force detection)        What is the best way to enrich logs with user info or location?        Can I use Elastic Security (SIEM app in Kibana) to build detection rules easily?        What about other logon-related event IDs like 4768 (Kerberos ticket request) or 4771 (pre-auth failure)?  Conclusion: My First Step into Detection EngineeringThis post helped me move from theoretical understanding to practical skill-building with Elasticsearch and Windows logs. I now better understand:      How login events work on Windows        How to query and filter them using KQL        How to use Elasticsearch and Kibana as lightweight SIEM components        Next, I want to explore Elastic Security, and maybe even try shipping Linux logs or network traffic into the stack. The possibilities are wide open.  If you’re on the same journey or have tips for me, I’d love to hear them. What logs or events do you think I should dive into next?Thanks for reading!

    "content": "What Makes Me StartI just started my first work as SOC Analyst back in march 2025. When I first started, my manager asking me to install and play around with Elasticsearch. An application that I never heard before. My first thought is just “meh, it’s just another apps, what could be so difficult about it”.Basically What My Experience Looks likeOh boy was I so wrong. Elastic is a giant to learn in itself, so much of features, processes and many other that I should learn from the scratch. So in this post, I would like to begin with how I setting up my Elasticsearch. Hope you guys learn something from this post.What is Elasticsearch exactly?So, what’s about this ‘Elasticsearch’ being so difficult to me when I first encounter it, is that there’s three in one shenanigans for this applications. Imagine your system is screaming — “Things are breaking!” — but all the signs are scattered across thousands of log files in weird folders. You don’t have time to read all of them. Elasticsearch is like a giant smart search engine that stores and analyzes those logs fast. It helps you make sense of what’s happening in your system.So here’s a diagram to visualize how Elasticsearch worksDiagram of How Elasticsearch WorksAs you can see on the diagram, there’s so many components accompanying Elasticsearch itself. And from my experience alone here’s some of steps or things that I learn during my trial and errors.What I learned:  Always follow the correct order of installation: Elasticsearch → Kibana → Fleet.  Keep your tokens and fingerprints handy, don’t forget them.  Watch logs closely during setup — they often explain what’s wrong.The Installation ProceduresSo with that in mind, the steps that I follow to installing Elasticsearch and Kibana is this video below by Wasay Tech Tips.What’s Missing From The InstallationBut, here’s the catch. After I done following and installing Elasticsearch and Kibana based on that video, I still don’t have log or any data showing up on my Elasticsearch. And turns out, I need to install the Agent for it to be working properly.So the way Elasticsearch works is that the node or in this case my laptop to be able to sent log or data to Elasticsearch is by having agent installed on my device. So that is what I do, installing the agent and here’s how I do it.  First you need to install the agent from the official Elasticsearch website here.      After downloading it, extract the file and head inside the file of the downloaded agent file and then type cmd on the address bar and press enter. This will make cmd open on that file path.    The cmd shows up, don’t enter installation command yet. Head to your Elasticsearch localhost shown in the picture below.  In the Fleet menu, click on “Add Fleet Server”.  Next, the add server menu shows up and this is where we could select where we wanted to put our fleet server. In my case, I put on the localhost address with port 8220(you could get the localhost address from the configuration yml file) and click continue.  The fleet server location has been set, next step is to copy the installation command line to the previously started cmd. But keep in mind that for me, this command line from my localhost Elasticsearch is missing some key command line that I will show on the next step.  And for the final step of agent installation is to add this command to the cmd.    .\\elastic-agent.exe install ^  --fleet-server-es=https://192.168.56.1:9200 ^  --fleet-server-service-token=AAEAA... ^  --fleet-server-policy=6be1b061-868b..... ^  --fleet-server-es-ca-trusted-fingerprint=f54c4b...... ^  --fleet-server-port=8220        For the server service token, server policy, and ca trusted fingerprint it should be generated automatically if you on fresh installment. For my case, this is because I have previously installing agent and uninstall it again. So you should be getting it automatically if it’s firt time installment.Next, paste it on the cmd like picture below.  And with that, the Elasticsearch installation should be completed now.Setting Up IntegrationBut we’re not done yet, we still need those integration for our Elasticsearch to work properly. So next up is, setting the integration.  From the navigation side bar menu, we can find the Integration tab. Click that and we will be routed to integration menu.  Once we in the integration menu, we could then search for the relevant integration that satisfy our needs. For this tutorial, I need Kibana for visualizing my log so that I could understand all of the data that being collected. We could use the search bar for finding Kibana. And once Kibana found, click on it.  Now that we’re in Kibana installation menu, click “Add Kibana” button. This way we can begin the installation process.  Usually, all the previous steps above should be set by default. The one that we want to set however is “Where to add this integration” option. This option asking us in what agent policies that we want to put out integration. For me because my fleet server is on agent policies 8, I have to put my Kibana on that so it can work with the fleet server.  After that, it will give prompt like this. Just click “Save and deploy changes”.  And wait for the installation to completed and voilà our integration installed successfully.But What Agent Policies?Now you might be wondering, “What is this policies exactly? Are they like rules? Or what?”. Now when I first installed Elastic I also have the same question and turns out, Agent Policies are like a set of instructions that tells each Elastic Agent what to do, what to collect, and where to send it. It’s like handing your agent a to-do list:  What logs or metrics to monitor (e.g., Windows Event Logs, system metrics)  Which integrations are enabled (like Winlogbeat, Filebeat, System, etc.)  Where the data goes (usually to Elasticsearch)  Whether the agent can auto-update or be centrally managedEach device running an Elastic Agent is tied to one of these policies. So if I have 5 computers with Elastic Agents and they’re all doing the same job (like collecting Windows logs), I can put them under the same policy. That way, if I change something in that policy — boom 💥 — it applies to all of them at once. Super convenient.Elastic even lets you have multiple policies so you can customize agents differently for servers, workstations, cloud VMs, etc.The DashboardAnd with all of the installation process, here’s what Elasticsearch dashboard look like if the installation succeeded.Final ThoughtsThis blog isn’t meant to be perfect. It’s real. If you’re learning Elastic and security monitoring with just one machine and zero prior experience, I hope this helps. My goals for writing this blog is to help others and future me in-case need to start from zero again on the elastic installation, so this blog could make as an knowledge based to others and me too.Thank you so much for reading this and have a nice day where ever you are."
